    "# Introduction to Computers and programming\n",
    "### Introduction 1.1\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers perform such a wide variety of tasks because they can\\\n",
    "be programmed to. This means that computers are not designed to do just\\\n",
    "one job, but to do any job that their program tells them to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "A program is a set of instructions that a computer follows to perform task\\\n",
    "Microsoft Word and PowerPoint are 2 commonly used programs.\\\n",
    "Programs are commonly referred to as software. All the software that we\\\n",
    "use to make our computers useful are created by individuals working asprogrammers\\\n",
    "or software developers.\n",
    "\n",
    "A programmer or software developer, is a person with the training and skills\\\n",
    "necessary to design, create, and test computer programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hardware and Software 1.2\n",
    "\n",
    "The physical devices of which a computer is made are referred to as the\\\n",
    "computers' hardware. The programs that run on the computer are\\\n",
    "referred to as software.\n",
    "\n",
    "The term hardware refers to all the physical devices, or  components, of\\\n",
    "which a computer is made. A computer is not a single device but a system of devices\\\n",
    "that all work together.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical computer system consists of the following major components:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A central processing unit(CPU)\n",
    "- Main memory\n",
    "- secondary storage devices\n",
    "- output devices\n",
    "- input devices\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The CPU\n",
    "\n",
    "When a computer is performing the tasks that a program tells it to do,\\\n",
    "we say that the computer is running or executing the program. The\\\n",
    "central processing unit, or CPU, is the part of the computer that\\\n",
    "actually runs the programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CPU is the most important component in a computer  because without it\\\n",
    "the computer would not run software.\n",
    "\n",
    "CPUs are all small chips known as microprocessors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main memory\n",
    "\n",
    "You can think of main memory as the computers' work area.\\\n",
    "This is where the computer stores a program while the program is running,\\\n",
    "as well as the data the program is working with.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Secondary Storage device \n",
    "\n",
    "Secondary Storage is a type of memory that can hold data for long periods of time,\\\n",
    "even when there is no power to the computer. Programs are normally stored in secondary\\\n",
    "memory and loaded into main memory as needed. Important data, such as word processing documents,\\\n",
    "payroll data, and inventory records, is saved in secondary storage as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common type of secondary storage device is the disk drive.\\\n",
    "A traditional disk drive stores data by magnetically encoding it\\\n",
    "onto a spinning circular disk.\n",
    " \n",
    "External storage devices, which connect to one of the computers' communication ports,\\\n",
    "are also available. External storage devices can be used to create backup\\\n",
    "copies of important data or to move data to another computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "USB drives are small devices tha plug into the computers' USB port and\\\n",
    "appear to the system as a disk drive. These drives do not actually contain\\\n",
    "a disk , however, the store data in a special type of memory known as flash memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input devices\n",
    "\n",
    "Input is any data the computer collects from people and from other devices.\\\n",
    "The component that collects data and sends it to the computer is called an input device.\\\n",
    "Common input devices are keyboard, mouse, touchscreen, scanner, microphone, and digital cam.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output devices\n",
    "\n",
    "Output is any data the computer produces for people or for other devices.\\\n",
    "It might be a sales report, a list of names, or a graphic image.\\\n",
    "The data is sent to an output device, which formats and presents it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Software\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything a computer does from the time you turn the power switch on until you\\\n",
    "shut the system down, is under the control of software\n",
    "\n",
    "### System software\n",
    "\n",
    "The programs that control and manage the basic operations of a computer are\\\n",
    "referred to as system software. System software typically includes\\\n",
    "the following types of programs:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Operating Systems\n",
    "\n",
    "An Operating System is the most fundamental set of programs on a computer.\\\n",
    "The operating system controls the internal operations of the computers hardware,\\\n",
    "manages all the devices connected to the computer, allows data to be saved to and retrieved\\\n",
    "from storage devices and allows other programs to run on the computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Utility Programs\n",
    "\n",
    "A Utility Program performs a specialized task that enhances the computers'\\\n",
    "operation or safeguards data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: virus scanners.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Software Development Tools\n",
    "\n",
    "Software Development Tools are the programs that programmers use to create,modify,\\\n",
    "and test software.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assemblers, Compilers, and interpreters are good examples of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How computers store data 1.3\n",
    "\n",
    "A computers memory is divided into tiny storage locations known as bytes.\\\n",
    "One byte is enough memory to store a letter of the alphabet or a small number.\\\n",
    "In order to do anything meaningful, a computer has to have lots of bytes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each byte is divided into eight smaller storage known as bits.\\\n",
    "The term bit stands for binary digit.\n",
    "\n",
    "When data is stored in a byte, the computer sets the eight bits to an on/off pattern\\\n",
    "that represents the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on whether the bit is turned on or off, it can represent one or two different values.\\\n",
    "In computer systems, a bit that is turned off represents the number 0, and a bit that\\\n",
    "is turned on represents the number 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "This corresponds to the binary numbering system.\\\n",
    "In binary numbering system all numeric values are written as sequences of 0s and 1s.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "10011101 = 157\n",
    "\n",
    "The position of each digit in a binary number has a value assigned to it.\\\n",
    "Starting with the right most digit and moving left, the position values 2**0, 2**1, 2**2,\\\n",
    " 2**3, and so forth, as shown.\n",
    " \n",
    "To determine the values of a binary number you simply add up the position\\\n",
    "values of all the 1s, the sum is the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Storing Characters\n",
    "\n",
    "Any piece of data that is in a computer's memory must be stored as\\\n",
    "a binary number. When a character is stored it is first converted into\\\n",
    "numeric code, and is then stored as memory. Over the year different coding\\\n",
    "schemes have been developed to represent characters in computer memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important of these coding schemes is ASCII. ASCII is a set of\\\n",
    "128 numeric codes that represent the English letters, various punctuation marks,\\\n",
    "and other characters. ASCII is limited because it defines codes for only 128 characters.\\\n",
    "To remedy this, the unicode character set was developed in the early 1990s.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unicode is an extensive encoding scheme that is compatible with ASCII\\\n",
    "but can also represent characters for many of the languages in the world.\\\n",
    "Today, Unicode is quickly becoming the standard character set used in the\\\n",
    "computers' industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advanced Number Storage\n",
    "\n",
    "Negative numbers and real numbers cannot be represented using the simple binary\\\n",
    "numbering technique we discussed. Computers are able to store negative numbers\\\n",
    "and real numbers in memory, but to do so they use encoding schemes along with the\\\n",
    "binary numbering system. Negative numbers are encoded using a technique known as\\\n",
    "two's complement, and real numbers are encoded in floating point notation.\\\n",
    "(You don't need to know how these encoding systems work)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other types of data\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers are often referred to as digital devices. The term digital can be used\\\n",
    "to describe anything that uses binary numbers. Digital data is data that is stored\\\n",
    "in binary format, and a digital device is any device that works with binary data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How a Program Works\n",
    "\n",
    "A computer's CPU can only understand instructions that are written in machine language.\n",
    "Because people find it very difficult to write entire programs in machine language\n",
    " other programming languages have been invented.\n",
    " \n",
    "Earlier we stated the CPU is the most important component in a computer because\n",
    "it is the part of the computer that runs programs. Somtimes the CPU is called\n",
    "the computers' brain and is described as being smart. A CPU is an electronic device\n",
    "that is designed to do specific things.\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular the CPU is designed to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reading a piece of data from the main memory\n",
    "- Adding two numbers\n",
    "- Subtracting one number from another number\n",
    "- Multiplying two numbers\n",
    "- Dividing one number by another number\n",
    "- Moving a piece of data from one memory location to another\n",
    "- Determine whether one value is equal to another value\n",
    "\n",
    "The CPU performs simple operations on pieces of data. The CPU does nothing on\\\n",
    "its own, however. It has to be told what to do, and that's the purpose of a program.\\\n",
    "A program is nothing more than a list of instructions that cause the CPU to perform operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of said instructions:\n",
    "10110000\n",
    "\n",
    "When a CPU executes the instructions in a program, it is engaged in a\n",
    "process that is known as the fetch-decode-execute cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "This cycle which consist of three steps, is repeated for each\\\n",
    "instruction in the program. The steps are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Fetch**. A program is a long sequence of instructions. The first step of the\\\n",
    "cycle is to fetch, or read, the next instruction from memory into the CPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Decode**. A machine language instruction is a binary number represents a command\\\n",
    "that tells the CPU to perform an operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this step, the CPU decodes the instruction that was just fetched from memory,\n",
    "to determine it should perform.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Execute**. The last in the cycle is to execute, or perform, the operation.\\\n",
    "\n",
    "### From Machine Language to Assembly Language\n",
    "\n",
    "Computers can only execute programs that are written in machine language. As\\\n",
    "previously mentioned a program can have thousands or even millions of binary instructions,\\\n",
    "and writing such a program would be very tedious and time-consuming. Programming\\\n",
    "in machine language would also be very difficult, because putting a 0 or a 1 in the\\\n",
    "wrong place will cause an error. Although a computers' CPU only understands machine language,\\\n",
    "it is impractical for people to write programs in machine language.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, assembly language was created in the early days of computing as an\\\n",
    "alternative to machine language. Instead of using binary numbers for instructions,\\\n",
    "assembly languages uses short words that are known mnemonics.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in assembly language, the mnemonics **add** typically adds numbers,\\\n",
    "**mul** typically multiplies numbers, and **mov** typically means to move a value\\\n",
    "to a location in memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "The CPU only understands machine language, so a special program known as assembler\\\n",
    "is used to translate an assembly language program to a machine language program. \n",
    "\n",
    "### High-Level Languages\n",
    "\n",
    "Although assembly language makes it unnecessary to write binary machine language\\\n",
    "instructions, it is not without difficulties.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assembly language is primarily a direct substitute for machine language, and like\\\n",
    "machine language, it requires that you know alot about the CPU. Assembly language\\\n",
    "also requires that write a large number of instructions for even the simplests programs.\\\n",
    "Because assembly language is so close in nature to machine language it is referred to as\\\n",
    "low-level languages. In the 1950s, a new generation of programming languages known\\\n",
    "as high-level languages began to appear.\n",
    "\n",
    "A high-level language allows you to create powerful and complex programs without\\\n",
    "knowing the CPU works and without writing\n",
    "\n",
    "large numbers of low-level instructions. In addition, most high-level languages\\\n",
    "use words that easy to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a modern, high-level programming language that we will use.\\\n",
    "In Python, you would display the message Hello World with the following\\\n",
    "on the computer screen:\n",
    "\n",
    "print(\"Hello World\")\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Keywords, Operators, and Syntax: An Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Each high-level language has its own set of predefined words that the programmer\\\n",
    "must use to write a program. The words that make up a high-level programming language\\\n",
    "are known as keywords or reserved words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each key word has a specific meaning, and cannot be used for any other purpose.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to keywords, programming languages have operators that perform various\\\n",
    "operations on data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, all programming languages have math operators that perform arithmetic.\\\n",
    "In Python, as well as other languages, the + sign is an operator that adds two numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to keywords and operators, each language has their own syntax,\\\n",
    "which is a set of rules we must follow when writing a program.\\\n",
    "syntax dictates how keywords and operators must be used in a program. \n",
    "\n",
    "The individual instructions that you use to write in a high-level programming language\\\n",
    "are called statement. A programming statement can consist of keywords, operators, punctuation,\\\n",
    "and other allowable programming elements, arranged in the proper sequence to perform an operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Compilers and Interpreters\n",
    "\n",
    "A compiler is a program that translates a high level language into a separate machine\\\n",
    "language program. The machine language program can be executed anytime it is needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "An interpreter is a program that both translater and executes the instructions in a\\\n",
    "high-level language program. As the interpreter reads the instructions, it converts it\\\n",
    "to machine language then executes it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The statements that a programmer writes in a high-level language is called code\\\n",
    "or source code. Typically, the programmer types a code into a text editor then\\\n",
    "saves the code in a file on the computers' disk.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next the programmer uses a compiler or an interpreter to translate and execute the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "A syntax error is a mistake such as a misspelled key word or a missing punctuation\\\n",
    "character. When this happens, the compiler or interpreter displays an error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Python 1.5\n",
    "### Installing Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you can try any of the programs shown in this book, or write ant of your own,\\\n",
    "you need to make sure that Python is installed on your computer and properly configured.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Python Interpreter\n",
    "\n",
    "When you install python your computer, one of the items that is installed is\\\n",
    "the Python interpreter. The Python interpreter is a program that can read Python\\\n",
    "programming statements and executes them.\n",
    "\n",
    " The interpreter has two mode: interactive mode and script mode. In interactive mode,\\\n",
    " interpreter waits for you to type Python statements on the keyboard.\\\n",
    " The interpreter then executes it then waits for you to type another statements.\\\n",
    " In script mode, interpreter reads the contents of a file that contains Python statements.\n",
    " \n",
    "### Interactive Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "Once Python has been installed and set up on your system, you start the interpreter in\\\n",
    "interactive mode by going to the operating systems' command line and typing\\\n",
    "the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using windows you can alternatively type python in the windows search box.\\\n",
    "In the search results you will see a program called Python 3.5 clicking it will start\\\n",
    "the interpreter in interactive mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "When the Python interpreter starts in interactive mode you will see the following\\\n",
    "on the screen:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Pytho 3.5.1 (v3.5.1: 37a07cee5969, Dec 6 2015, 01:38:48)\n",
    "[MSC v.1900 32 bit (intel)] on win32\n",
    "Type \"help\", \"copyright\", \"credits\" or \"license\"\n",
    "for more information.\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The >>> that you see indicates the interpreter is waiting for you to type a\\\n",
    "Python statement. After typing the statement, you press the enter key, and the\\\n",
    "Python interpreter executes the statement. After the statement is executed on the\\\n",
    "screen the >>> appears again indicating that the interpreter is waiting for you\\\n",
    "to enter the next statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Writing Python Programs and Running Them in Script Mode\n",
    "\n",
    "Although interactive mode is useful for testing code, the statements that you enter\\\n",
    "in interactive mode are not saved as a program. They're simply executed and their results\\\n",
    "are displayed on screen. if you want to save a set of Python statements as a program, you\\\n",
    "must save them in a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you save a Python program, you  give it a name that ends with the .py extension\\\n",
    "which identifies it as a Python program. For example,  you might save the program\\\n",
    "previously shown with name test.py. To run the program, you would go to the directory\\\n",
    "in which the file is saved and type the following command in the operating system:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "pyhton test.py\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Causing it to execute the statements in test.py.\n",
    "\n",
    "### the IDLE Programming Environment\n",
    "Previously you learned how the python interpreter can be starred in interactive\\\n",
    "mode at the operating system command line. As an alternative you can use an integrated\\\n",
    "development environment(IDLE), which is a single program that gives you all the tools\\\n",
    "you need to write, execute, and test a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "IDLE is automatically installed when Python language is installed. IDLE has a built-in text\\\n",
    "editor with features specifically designed to help you write Python programs."
