    "### Problem Solving with Recursion 12.2\n",
    "**Concept**: A problem can be solved with recursion if it can be broken down into\\\n",
    "smaller problems that are identical in structure to the overall problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursive is commonly studied in upper-level computer science courses, it may not\\\n",
    "be clear of how to use recursion to solve a problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "First note, recursion is never required to solve a problem. Any problem that can\\\n",
    "be solved with recursion can also be solved with a loop. In fact, recursion algorithms\\\n",
    "are usually less efficient than iterative algorithms. This is because the process of\\\n",
    "calling a function requires several actions to be performed by the computer. These actions\\\n",
    "which are referred to as overhead, take place with each function call. Such overhead is not\\\n",
    "necessary with a loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some repetitive problems are more easily solved with recursion than with a loop. where a\\\n",
    "loop might result in faster execution time, the programmer might be able to design a recursive\\\n",
    "function faster. In general, a recursive function works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- If the problem can be solved now, without recursion, then the function solves it and returns.\n",
    "- If the problem cannot be solved now, then the function reduces it to a smaller similar problem and calls itself to solve the smaller problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to apply this approach, first we introduce at least one case in which the problem\\\n",
    "can be solved without recursion, known as the base case. Second, we determine a way to solve\\\n",
    "the problem in all other circumstances using recursion, this is called recursive case.\\\n",
    "By reducing a problem with each recursive call, the base case will eventually be reached\\\n",
    "and the recursion will stop.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Recursion to Calculate the Factorial of a Number 12.3\n",
    "The notation n! represents the factorial of the number n. The factorial of a nonnegative\\\n",
    "number can be defined by the following rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "if n = 0 then n! = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "if n > 0 then n! = 1 x 2 x 3 x ...x n\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's replace the notation n! with factorial(n), which looks a bit more like computer code,\\\n",
    "and write these rules as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "if n = 0 then factorial(n) = 1\n",
    "\n",
    "if n > 0 then factorial(n) = 1 x 2 x 3 x ...x n\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These rules are when n is 0, its factorial is 1. When n is greater than 0, its factorial is\\\n",
    "the product of all the positive integers from 1 up to n. For instance , factorial(6) is\\\n",
    "calculated as 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x 5 x 6.\n",
    "\n",
    "When designing a recursive algorithm to calculate the factorial of any number, first we\\\n",
    "identify the base case, which is part of the calculation that we can solve without recursion.\\\n",
    "This is the case were n is equal to 0 as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "if n = 0 then   factorial(n) = 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This tells us how to solve the problem when n is equal to 0, but what do we do when n is\\\n",
    "greater than 0? That is the recursive case, or the part of the problem we use recursive\\\n",
    "to solve. This is how we express it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "if n > 0 then   factorial(n) = n x factorial(n - 1)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This states that if n is greater than 0, the factorial of n is n times the factorial of n - 1.\\\n",
    "Notice how recursive call works on a reduced version of the problem. So our recursive rule for\\\n",
    "calculating the factorial of a number might look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
