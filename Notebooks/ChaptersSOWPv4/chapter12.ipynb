    "### Problem Solving with Recursion 12.2\n",
    "**Concept**: A problem can be solved with recursion if it can be broken down into smaller problems that are identical in structure to the overall problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursive is commonly studied in upper-level computer science courses, it may not be clear of how to use recursion to solve a problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "First note, recursion is never required to solve a problem. Any problem that can be solved with recursion can also be solved with a loop. In fact, recursion algorithms are usually less efficient than iterative algorithms. This is because the process of calling a function requires several actions to be performed by the computer. These actions which are referred to as overhead, take place with each function call. Such overhead is not necessary with a loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some repetitive problems are more easily solved with recursion than with a loop. "
