    "### Graphical user interface 13.1\n",
    "**Concept**: A graphical user interface allows the user to interact with the operating\\\n",
    "system and other programs using graphical elements such as icons, buttons, and dialogue boxes.\n",
    "\n",
    "One part of the user interface consist of hardware devices, such as the keyboard and\\\n",
    "the video display. Another part lies in the way that the computer's operating system\\\n",
    "accepts commands from the user. For years, the only way that the user could interact\\\n",
    "with the operating system was through a command line interface. A command line interface\\\n",
    "typically displays a prompt, and the user types a command, which is then executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many users find command line interfaces difficult to use because there are many commands\\\n",
    "to be learned, and each command has its own syntax, much like a programming statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "A new type of interface known as a graphical user interface came into use in commercial\\\n",
    "operating systems. A graphical user interface allows user to interact with the operating\\\n",
    "system and other programs using graphical elements on the screen. GUI popularized the use\\\n",
    "of the mouse as an input device, instead the user having to type commands, GUI allows the\\\n",
    "user to point at graphical elements and use the mouse to click them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Much of the interaction with GUI is done through dialogue boxes, which are small windows\\\n",
    "that display information and allows the user to perform actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### GUI programs are Event driven\n",
    "A command line interface, determines the order in which things happen. The user has no\\\n",
    "choice but to enter data in the order that is requested. In a GUI environment, the user\\\n",
    "determines the order in which things happen, because GUI programs must respond to the\\\n",
    "actions of the user, is said that they're event-driven.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using the tkinter Module 13.2\n",
    "**Concept**: In python, you can use the tkinter module to create simple GUI programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python doesn't have built-in GUI programming features built into the language, but it\\\n",
    "does have a module named tkinter that allows you to create GUI programs. The name tkinter\\\n",
    "is short for \"TK interface\". It's named this because it provides a way for programmers to\\\n",
    "use a GUI library named Tk. \n",
    "\n",
    "GUI program presents a window with various graphical widgets with which the user can interact\\\n",
    "with and use. The tkinter module provides 15 widgets, which are described in the table below.\\\n",
    "We won't cover all the tkinter widgets in this chapter, but we will demonstrate how to create\\\n",
