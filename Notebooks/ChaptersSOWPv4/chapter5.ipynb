    "### Introduction to function 5.1\n",
    "**Concept**:A function is a group of statements that exist within a program for the purpose of performing a specific task.\n",
    "\n",
    "In chapter 2 we described a simple algorithm for calculating an employees pay. In the algorithm\\\n",
    "the number of hours worked is multiplied by an hourly pay rate. A more realistic payroll algorithm,\\\n",
    "however, would do much more than this. In a real-world application, the overall task of calculating\\\n",
    "an employees pay would consist of several subtasks, such as the following:\n",
    "- Getting the employee's hourly pay rate\n",
    "- Getting the number of hours worked\n",
    "- Calculating the employee's gross pay\n",
    "- calculating overtime pay\n",
    "- Calculating withholding's for taxes and benefits\n",
    "- Calculating the net pay\n",
    "- Printing the pay check\n",
    "\n",
    "Most programs perform tasks that are large enough to be broken into several subtasks. For this reason,\\\n",
    "programmers usually break down their programs into small manageable pieces known as function.\\\n",
    "A function is a group of statements that exist within a program for the purpose of performing a\\\n",
    "specific task. Instead of writing a large program as one long sequence of statements, it can be\\\n",
    "written as small statements, each one is performing a specific part of the task. These small function\\\n",
    "can then be executed in the desired order to perform the overall task.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is sometimes called divide and conquer. You generally isolate each task within the\\\n",
    "program in its own function. For example, a realistic pay calculating program might have the following functions:\n",
    "- A function that gets the employee's hourly pay rate\n",
    "- A function that gets the number of hours worked\n",
    "- A function that calculates the employee's gross pay\n",
    "- A function that calculates the overtime pay\n",
    "- A function that calculates the withholding's for taxes and benefits\n",
    "- A function that calculates the net pay\n",
    "- A function that prints the pay check\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called a modularized program...\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of modularizing a program with functions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simpler Code**\n",
    "A program's code tends to be simpler and easier to understand when it is broken down into functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Reuse**\n",
    "Function also reduce the duplication of code within a program. If a specific operation is\\\n",
    "performed in several places in a program, a function can be written once to perform that operation,\\\n",
    "then be executed any tine it is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Better Testing**\n",
    "When each task within a program is contained in its own function, testing and debugging becomes simpler.\\\n",
    "Programmers can test each function in program individually, to determine whether it correctly performs its operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Faster Development**\n",
    "Suppose a programmer or a team of programmers is developing multiple programs. They discover that\\\n",
    "each of the programs perform several common tasks, such as asking for a username and password,\\\n",
    "displaying the current time, and so on. It doesn't make sense to write code for these tasks multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Easier Facilitation of Teamwork**\n",
    "Functions also make it easier for programmers to work in teams. when a program is developed as\\\n",
    "a set of function that each performs an individual task, then different programmers can be assigned\\\n",
    "the job of writing different functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### void functions and value-returning functions\n",
    "When you call a void function, it simply executes the statements it contains and then terminates.\\\n",
    "When you call a value-returning function, it executes the statement that it contains, then returns\\\n",
    "a value back to the statement that called it. The input function is an example of a value-returning\\\n",
    "function. The first type of function that we will learn is the void function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining a Calling a Void Function 5.2\n",
    "**concept**: The code for a function is known as a function definition. To execute the function,\\\n",
    "you write a statement that calls it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function names\n",
    "A functions name should be descriptive enough so anyone reading your code can reasonably guess what the\\\n",
    "function does. Python requires that you follow the same rules that you follow when naming variables.\\\n",
    "Because functions perform action, most programmers prefer to use verbs in function names for example a\\\n",
    "function that calculates gross play might be named, calculate_gross_pay.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining and Calling a Function\n",
    "To create a function, you write its definition. here is the general format of a function definition in Python:\n",
    "```\n",
    "def function():\n",
    "    statement\n",
    "    statement\n",
    "    etc.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line is known as the function header. It marks the beginning of the function definition.\\\n",
    "The function header begins with the key word def, followed by the name of the function,\\\n",
    "followed by a set of parentheses, followed a colon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Begging at the next statement is a set of statements known as a block. A block is simply a set of\\\n",
    "statements that belong together as a group. These statements are performed any time the function is executed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at an example of a function. Keep in mind that this is not a complete program. We will show the entire program in a moment."

    "### Indentation in Python\n",
    "Each line in a block must be indented. The last indented line is after the function a function header is the last line\\\n",
    "in the function's block. When you indent the lines in a block, make sure each line begins with the same number of spaces.\\\n",
    "There are two ways to indent a line: (1) by pressing the Tab key at the beginning of the line, or (2) by using the space\\\n",
    "bar to insert spaces at the begginig of the line. You can use either tabs or spaces when indenting the lines in a block,\\\n",
    "but don't use both doing so could cause an error. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Designing a Program to Use Functions 5.3\n",
    "**Concept**:programmers commonly use a technique known as top-down design break down an algorithm into functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Flowing charting a Program with Functions\n",
    "In a flowchart a function call is shown with a rectangle that has vertical bars at each side. The name of the function\\\n",
    "that is being called is written on the symbol. Programmers typically draw a separate flowchart for each function in a program.\\\n",
    "When drawing a flowchart for a function, the starting terminal symbol usually shows the name of the function and the ending\\\n",
    "terminal symbol usually reads Return.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Top-Down Design\n",
    "You've seen how control of a program is transferred to a function when it is called, then returns to the part of the\\\n",
    "program that called the function when the function ends. It is important that you understand these mechanical aspects of functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programmers commonly use a technique known as top-down design to break down an algorithm into functions.\\\n",
    "The process of top-down design is performed the following manner:\n",
    "- The overall task that the program is to perform is broken down into a series of subtasks.\n",
    "- Each of the subtasks is examined to determine whether it can be further broken down into more subtasks. This step is repeated until no more subtasks can be identified.\n",
    "- Once all the subtasks have been identified, they are written in code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hierarchy Charts\n",
    "A Hierarchy chart which is also known as a structure chart, shows boxes that represent each function in a program.\\\n",
    "The boxes are connected in a way that illustrates the functions called by each function. The hierarchy chart doesn't\\\n",
    "show the steps that are taken inside a function. Because they don't reveal any detail about how function work,\\\n",
    "they do not replace flowchart or pseudocode.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pausing Execution Until the User presses Enter\n",
    "When the user is ready for the program to continue execution, he or she preses the Enter key and the program resumes.\\\n",
    "In Python, you can use the input function to cause a program to pause until the user presses the Enter key.\\\n",
    "This statement displays the prompt 'Press Enter to see Step 1.' and pauses until the user presses the Enter the key.\n",
