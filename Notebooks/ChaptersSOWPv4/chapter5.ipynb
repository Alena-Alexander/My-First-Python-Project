    "### Introduction to function 5.1\n",
    "**Concept**:A function is a group of statements that exist within a program for the purpose of performing a specific task.\n",
    "\n",
    "In chapter 2 we described a simple algorithm for calculating an employees pay. In the algorithm\\\n",
    "the number of hours worked is multiplied by an hourly pay rate. A more realistic payroll algorithm,\\\n",
    "however, would do much more than this. In a real-world application, the overall task of calculating\\\n",
    "an employees pay would consist of several subtasks, such as the following:\n",
    "- Getting the employee's hourly pay rate\n",
    "- Getting the number of hours worked\n",
    "- Calculating the employee's gross pay\n",
    "- calculating overtime pay\n",
    "- Calculating withholding's for taxes and benefits\n",
    "- Calculating the net pay\n",
    "- Printing the pay check\n",
    "\n",
    "Most programs perform tasks that are large enough to be broken into several subtasks. For this reason,\\\n",
    "programmers usually break down their programs into small manageable pieces known as function.\\\n",
    "A function is a group of statements that exist within a program for the purpose of performing a\\\n",
    "specific task. Instead of writing a large program as one long sequence of statements, it can be\\\n",
    "written as small statements, each one is performing a specific part of the task. These small function\\\n",
    "can then be executed in the desired order to perform the overall task.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach is sometimes called divide and conquer. You generally isolate each task within the\\\n",
    "program in its own function. For example, a realistic pay calculating program might have the following functions:\n",
    "- A function that gets the employee's hourly pay rate\n",
    "- A function that gets the number of hours worked\n",
    "- A function that calculates the employee's gross pay\n",
    "- A function that calculates the overtime pay\n",
    "- A function that calculates the withholding's for taxes and benefits\n",
    "- A function that calculates the net pay\n",
    "- A function that prints the pay check\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called a modularized program...\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of modularizing a program with functions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Simpler Code**\n",
    "A program's code tends to be simpler and easier to understand when it is broken down into functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Code Reuse**\n",
    "Function also reduce the duplication of code within a program. If a specific operation is\\\n",
    "performed in several places in a program, a function can be written once to perform that operation,\\\n",
    "then be executed any tine it is needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Better Testing**\n",
    "When each task within a program is contained in its own function, testing and debugging becomes simpler.\\\n",
    "Programmers can test each function in program individually, to determine whether it correctly performs its operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Faster Development**\n",
    "Suppose a programmer or a team of programmers is developing multiple programs. They discover that\\\n",
    "each of the programs perform several common tasks, such as asking for a username and password,\\\n",
    "displaying the current time, and so on. It doesn't make sense to write code for these tasks multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Easier Facilitation of Teamwork**\n",
    "Functions also make it easier for programmers to work in teams. when a program is developed as\\\n",
    "a set of function that each performs an individual task, then different programmers can be assigned\\\n",
    "the job of writing different functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### void functions and value-returning functions\n",
    "When you call a void function, it simply executes the statements it contains and then terminates.\\\n",
    "When you call a value-returning function, it executes the statement that it contains, then returns\\\n",
    "a value back to the statement that called it. The input function is an example of a value-returning\\\n",
    "function. The first type of function that we will learn is the void function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining a Calling a Void Function 5.2\n",
    "**concept**: The code for a function is known as a function definition. To execute the function,\\\n",
    "you write a statement that calls it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Function names\n",
    "A functions name should be descriptive enough so anyone reading your code can reasonably guess what the\\\n",
    "function does. Python requires that you follow the same rules that you follow when naming variables.\\\n",
    "Because functions perform action, most programmers prefer to use verbs in function names for example a\\\n",
    "function that calculates gross play might be named, calculate_gross_pay.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining and Calling a Function\n",
    "To create a function, you write its definition. here is the general format of a function definition in Python:\n",
    "```\n",
    "def function():\n",
    "    statement\n",
    "    statement\n",
    "    etc.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line is known as the function header. It marks the beginning of the function definition.\\\n",
    "The function header begins with the key word def, followed by the name of the function,\\\n",
    "followed by a set of parentheses, followed a colon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Begging at the next statement is a set of statements known as a block. A block is simply a set of\\\n",
    "statements that belong together as a group. These statements are performed any time the function is executed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at an example of a function. Keep in mind that this is not a complete program. We will show the entire program in a moment."

    "Each line in a block must be indented. The last indented line is after the function a function header is the last line\\\n",

    "There are two ways to indent a line: (1) by pressing the Tab key at the beginning of the line, or (2) by using the space\\\n",
    "bar to insert spaces at the begginig of the line. You can use either tabs or spaces when indenting the lines in a block,\\\n",
    "but don't use both doing so could cause an error. \n",

    "### Designing a Program to Use Functions 5.3\n",
    "**Concept**:programmers commonly use a technique known as top-down design break down an algorithm into functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Flowing charting a Program with Functions\n",
    "In a flowchart a function call is shown with a rectangle that has vertical bars at each side. The name of the function\\\n",
    "that is being called is written on the symbol. Programmers typically draw a separate flowchart for each function in a program.\\\n",
    "When drawing a flowchart for a function, the starting terminal symbol usually shows the name of the function and the ending\\\n",
    "terminal symbol usually reads Return.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Top-Down Design\n",
    "You've seen how control of a program is transferred to a function when it is called, then returns to the part of the\\\n",
    "program that called the function when the function ends. It is important that you understand these mechanical aspects of functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programmers commonly use a technique known as top-down design to break down an algorithm into functions.\\\n",
    "The process of top-down design is performed the following manner:\n",
    "- The overall task that the program is to perform is broken down into a series of subtasks.\n",
    "- Each of the subtasks is examined to determine whether it can be further broken down into more subtasks. This step is repeated until no more subtasks can be identified.\n",
    "- Once all the subtasks have been identified, they are written in code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hierarchy Charts\n",
    "A Hierarchy chart which is also known as a structure chart, shows boxes that represent each function in a program.\\\n",
    "The boxes are connected in a way that illustrates the functions called by each function. The hierarchy chart doesn't\\\n",
    "show the steps that are taken inside a function. Because they don't reveal any detail about how function work,\\\n",
    "they do not replace flowchart or pseudocode.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pausing Execution Until the User presses Enter\n",
    "When the user is ready for the program to continue execution, he or she preses the Enter key and the program resumes.\\\n",
    "In Python, you can use the input function to cause a program to pause until the user presses the Enter key.\\\n",
    "This statement displays the prompt 'Press Enter to see Step 1.' and pauses until the user presses the Enter the key.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Local Variable 5.4\n",
    "**Concept**: A local variable is a created inside a function and cannot be accessed by statements that are outside the function. Different function can have local variables with the same name because the functions cannot see each other's local variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you assign a value to a variable inside a function, you create a local variable. A local variable belongs to the function in which it is created, and only statements inside the function can access the variable. An error will occur if a statement in one function tries to access a local variable."

    "Most programmers agree that you should restrict the use of global variables, or not use them at all. The reasons are as follows:\n",
    "- Global variables make debugging difficult. Any statement in a program file can change the value of a global variable. If you find that the wrong value is being stored in a global variable, you have to track down every statement that accesses it to determine where the bad value is coming from.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Functions that use global variables are usually dependent on those variables. If you want to use a function in a different program, most likely you will have to redesign it, so it does not rely on the global variable.\n",

    "- A Global variable can be modified by any statement in the program. If you are to understand any part of the program that uses a global variable, you have to be aware of all the other parts of the program that access the global variable.\n",

    "### Global Constants\n",
    "It is permissible to use global constants in a program. A Global constant is a global name that references a value that cannot be changed. Because global constant's value cannot be changed during the program's execution, you don't have to worry about many of the potential hazards that are associated with the use of global variables. Python doesn't allow you to create true global constants, you can simulate them with global variables. If you don't declare a global variable with the global keyword inside a function, then you can't change the variable's assignment inside that function.\n",

    "### Introduction to Value-Returning Functions: Generating Random Numbers 5.7\n",
    "**Concept**: A value returning function is a function that returns a value back to the program that called it. Python, as well as most other programming languages, provides a library of prewritten functions that perform commonly needed task. These libraries typically contain a function that generated random numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "A value returning function is a special type of function. it is like a void function in the following ways.\n",
    "- It is a group of statements that perform a specific task\n",
    "- When you want to execute the function you call it.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a value-returning function finishes, however, it returns a value back to the part of the program that called it. The value that is returned from a function can be used by any other value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Standard Library Function and the import Statements\n",
    "Python comes with a standard library of function that have already been written for you. These functions, known as library functions, make a programmer's job easier because they perform many of the task that programmer's commonly need to perform. We've already used several of python's library function, such as print, input, and range. Some of pyons library functions are built into the python interpreter. many of the function in the standard library are stored in file that are known as modules. These modules, which are copied to your computer when you install python, help organize the standard library. For example, functions for performing math operations are stored in a module.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to call a function that is stored in a module, you have to write an import statement at the of your program. An import statement tells the interpreter the name of the module that contains the function. for example the math module contains various mathematical functions that work with floating numbers. If you want to use any of the math modules functions in a program, you should write the following import statement:\n",
    "```\n",
    "import math\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Because you don't see the internal working's of a library function, many programmer's think of them as black boxes. The term black box is used to describe any mechanism that accepts input, performs some operation using the input, and produces the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Generating Random Numbers\n",
    "random numbers are useful for lots of different programming tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Random numbers are commonly used in. For example, computer games that let the player roll dice use random numbers to represent the numbers of the dice.\n",
    "- Random numbers are useful in simulation programs. In some simulations, the computer must randomly decide how a person, animal, insect, or other living human being will behave.\n",
    "- Random numbers are useful in statistical programs that must randomly select data for analysis.\n",
    "- Ramdom numbers are commonly used in computer security to encrypt sensitive data.\n",
    "\n",
    "python provider several library functions for working with random numbers. These functions are stored in a module named random in the standard library.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first random number generating function that we will discuss in named randit. Because the random function is in the random module, We will need to use dot notation to refer to it in our program. In dot notation the functions name is random.randit. On the left side of the dot is the name of the module, and on the right side of the dot id the name of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is an example of how you might call the function:\n",
    "```\n",
    "number = random.randit(1, 100)\n",
