    "# Files and Exceptions\n",
    "### Introduction to file Input and Output 6.1\n",
    "**Concept**: When a program needs to save data for later, it writes the data in a file. The data can be read from the file at a later time.\n",
    "Data is saved in a file, which is usually stored in on a computer's disk. Once that data is saved in a file, in while remain there after the program stops running. Data stored in a file can be retrieved and used at a later time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the commercial software packages that you use on a day-to-day basis store data in files. The following are a few examples: \n",
    "- **Word processors.** Word processing programs are used to write letters, memos, reports, and other documents. The documents are then saved in file so they can be edited and printed.\n",
    "- **Image editors.** Image editing programs are used to draw graphics and edit images. The images that you create are saved in files.\n",
    "- **Spreadsheets.** Spreadsheet programs are used to work with numerical data. Number and mathematical formulas can be inserted in rows and columns of the spreadsheets. The spreadsheet can  be saved in a file for use later.\n",
    "- **Games.** Many computers games can keep data stored in files. \n",
    "- **Web browsers.** Sometimes when you visit a Web page, the browser stores a small file known as a cookie on your computer. Cookies typically contain information about the browsing sessions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programmer usually refer to the process of saving data to a file as \"writing data\" to the file. When a piece of data is written to a file, it is copied from a variable in RAM to the file. The term output file is used to describe a file that data is written to. The process of retrieving data from a file is known as \"reading data\" from the file. When a piece of data is from a file, it is copied from the file into RAM and referenced by a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter discusses how to write data to files and read data from files. There are always three steps that must be taken when a file is used by a program.\n",
    "**Open the file.** Opening a file creates a connection between the file and the program. Opening an output file usually creates the file on the disk and allows the program to write data to it. Opening an input file allows the program to read data from it.\n",
    "**Process the file.** In this step, either data is written to the file or read from it.\n",
    "**Close the file.** When a program is finished using the file, the file must be closed. Closing a file disconnects the file from the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of files\n",
    "There are two types of file: Texts and binary. A text file contains data that has been encoded as text, using a scheme such as ASCII or Unicode. Even if the file contains numbers, those number are stored in the file as a series of characters. As a result, the file may be opened and viewed in a text editor such as notepad. A binary file contains data the hasn't been converted to text. The data in a binary file is intended only for a program to read. As a result you cannot view the content of a binary file in a text binary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### file Access Methods\n",
    "Most programming languages provide two different ways to access data stored in a file. Sequential access and direct access. When you work with a sequential access file, you access data from the begging of the file to the end of the file. If you want to read a piece of data that is stored at the end of a file, you have to read all the data the comes before it -- you cannot jump directly to the desired data\n",
    "\n",
    "When you work with a direct access file you can jump directly to any piece of data in the file without reading data that comes before it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### File names and objects\n",
    "Files are identified by a filename. When you use utility such as Window Explorer to examine the context of your disk, you see a list of filenames. many systems support the use of filename extensions, which are short sequences of characters that appear at the end of a filename preceded by a period. The extensions you usually indicate the type stored in a file. For example the .jpg extension usually indicates the file contains a graphic image that is compressed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Opening a File\n",
    "You use the opening function in python to open a file. The open function creates a file object and associates it with a file on the disk. Here's an example of how the open function is used:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "file_variable = open(filename, mode)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the general format:\n",
    "- The file_variable is the name of the variable that will reference the file object \n",
    "- filename is a string specifying the name of the file\n",
    "- mode is a string specifying a mode in which the file will be opened\n",
    "\n",
    "| Mode | Description                                                                          |\n",
    "|------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| 'r'  | Opening a file for reading only                                                      |\n",
    "| 'w'  | Opening a file for writing only                                                      |\n",
    "| 'a'  | Open a file to be written to all data written to a file will be appended to its end. |\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specifying the location of a File\n",
    "when you pass a file name that doesn't a path as an argument to the open function, the python interpreter assumes the location is the same as that of the program. for example suppose a program is located in the following folder:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "C:/User/Blake/Documents/Python\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If the program is running and executes the following statement, the file statement.txt is in the same folder:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "test_file = open('statement.txt', 'w')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to open a file in a different location, you can specify the path as well as the file name in the argument that you pass the open function to. If you specify a path in a string literal be sure to prefix the string with the letter r. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "test_file = open(r'C:/Users/Blake/temp/test.txt', 'w')\n",
    "```\n",
    "The r prefix specifies that the string is a raw string.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Writing Data to a file\n",
    "A method is a function that belongs to an object and performs some operations using that object. Once you opened a file, you use the files object's methods to performs operations on the file. For example, file objects have a method called write that can be used to write data to a file. Here's a general format of how you can call the write method: \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "file_variable.write(string)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's assume customer_file references a file object, and the file was opened for writing with the 'w' mode. Here's an example of how we write the string 'Charles Pace' to the file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "customer_file.write('Charles Pace')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
