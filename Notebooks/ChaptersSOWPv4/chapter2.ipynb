    "### Designing a Program 2.1\n",
    "Programs must be carefully designed before they are written. During the design process,\\\n",
    "programmers use tools such as pseudocode and flowcharts to create models of programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Program Development Cycle\n",
    "The process of creating a program that works correctly typically requires the five phases shown.\\\n",
    "The process is known as the program development cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Program Development Cycle\n",
    "- **Design the program**. Tons of professional programmers will tell you that a program should be designed\\\n",
    "carefully before the code is written. When writing a program you should start by creating a design of the program,\\\n",
    "and there are plenty of ways to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Write the Code**. After designing the program, then you begin writing code in a high-level language.\\\n",
    "While remembering to follow the syntax rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Correct Syntax Errors**. If the program contains a syntax error, the compiler or interpreter will display\\\n",
    "an error message indicting what the error is. Once the error are corrected the code is able to be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Test the Program**. Once the code is in an executable form, it is then tested to determine whether any logic\\\n",
    "errors exist. A logic error is a mistake that doesn't stop the program form running, but causes it to produce result.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Correct Logic Errors**. If the program produces the incorrect results, the programmer debugs the code.\\\n",
    "Debugs means that the programmer finds and corrects logic errors in the program. Sometimes during the process the programmer\\\n",
    "- discovers that the programs' original design must be changed. in this event, the program development cycle starts over and\\\n",
    "- continues until no errors can be found.\n",
    "\n",
    "### More About the Design Process\n",
    "The process of designing a program is arguably the most important part of the cycle.\\\n",
    "You can think of a programs' design as its foundation. If you build a house on a poorly constructed foundation,\\\n",
    "eventually you'll find yourself doing alot of work to fix the house.\\\n",
    "So if your program is designed poorly eventually you will find yourself doing alot of work to fix it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of designing a program can be summarized in the following two steps:\n",
    "1. Understanding the task that the program is to perform.\n",
    "2. Determine the steps that must be taken to perform this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understand the Task That the Program Is to Perform\n",
    "it is essential that you understand what a program is supposed to do before designing it.\\\n",
    "Typically, a professional programmer gains this understanding by working directly with customer.\\\n",
    "We use the term customer to describe the person, group, or company asking you to write a program,\\\n",
    "or in a traditional sense someone who is paying you to write a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the interviews, the customer will describe the task that the program should perform,\\\n",
    "and programmer will ask questions to uncover as many details as possible about the task.\\\n",
    "A follow-up interview is usually needed because customers rarely mention everything they want the program to do,\\\n",
    "and programmers often think of additional questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The programmer studies the information that was gathered from the  during the interviews and creates a\\\n",
    "list of different software requirements. A software requirement is simply a single task that the program\\\n",
    "must perform in order to satisfy the customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Determine the Steps That Must be Taken to Perform the Task\n",
    "Once you understand the task that the program will perform, you begin by breaking down the to task into a series of steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example suppose someone asks you how to boil water, you break the task down into a series of steps as follows:\n",
    "1. Pour the desired amount of water into a pot.\n",
    "2. Put pot on a stove burner.\n",
    "3. Turn the burner to high.\n",
    "4. Watch the water until you see large bubbles rapidly rising. When this happens, the water is boiling.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an example of an algorithm, which a set of steps that must be taken to perform a task.\n",
    "\n",
    "A programmer breaks down the task that the program is meant to perform(As you would to explain boiling water).\\\n",
    "An algorythm is created, which is a list of all the logical steps that must be taken. For example(in terms of software)\\\n",
    "suppose you have been asked to write a program to calculate and display the gross pay for an hourly paid employee.\\\n",
    "Here are the steps to take:\n",
    "1. Get the number of hours worked.\n",
    "2. get the hourly pay rate.\n",
    "3. Multiply the number of hours worked by the hourly pay rate.\n",
    "4. Display the result of the calculation that was performed in step 3.\n",
    "Then the steps in the list would ofc have to code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pseudocode\n",
    "Because small mistakes in code can cause syntax errors, programmers find it helpful write programs in\\\n",
    "pseudocode before they write the actual code. Pseudocode is fake code, it is an informal language that has no syntax\\\n",
    "rules and is not meant to be compiled or executed. Instead, programmers use pseudocode to create models, or \"mock-ups,\" of programs.\\\n",
    "Because programmers don't have to worry about syntax errors while writing pseudocode,\\\n",
    "they can focus all their attention on the programs design.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Flowcharts\n",
    "Flowcharting is another tool programmers use to design programs.\\\n",
    "A Flowchart is a diagram that graphically depicts the steps that take place in a program.\\\n",
    "There are three symbols in a flowchart: Ovals, Parallelograms, and a rectangle.\\\n",
    "Each of these represent a step in the program, as described:\n",
    "- The ovals, which appear at the top or bottom of the chart, are called terminal symbols.\n",
    "The Start terminal symbol marks the programs starting point, and the End terminal symbol marks the programs ending point.\n",
    "- The parallelograms are uses as input symbols and output symbols. They represent steps in which the program reads inputs or displays output.\n",
    "- Rectangles are used  as processing symbols. The represent steps in which the program performs some process on data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input, Processing, and Output\n",
    "Input is data that the program receives. When a program receives data, it usually processes it by performing some operation on it.\\\n",
    "The result of the operation is sent out of the program as output\n",
    "\n",
    "Computer programs typically perform the following three-step process:\n",
    "1. Input is received.\n",
    "2. Some process is performed on the input.\n",
    "3. Output is produced.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input is any data that the program receives while it is running. one common form of input is data that is typed on the keyboard.\\\n",
    "Once input is received, some process, such as a mathematics calculation is done to it.\\\n",
    "The result of the process is sent out as an output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Displaying Output with the print Function\n",
    "You use the print function to display output in a python program. \n",
    "\n",
    "A function is piece of a prewritten code that performs an operation.\\\n",
    "Python has numerous built-in functions that perform various operations.\\\n",
    "The most fundamental built-in function is the print function.\\\n",
    "Here is an example that executes a print statement:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print('Hello world')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In interactive mode if you typed this statement, the message Hello world would be display\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> print('Hello world')\n",
    "Hello world\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When programmers execute a function, they say they're calling the function. When you call the print function,\\\n",
    "you type the word print, followed by a set of parentheses. Inside the parentheses, you type an argument,\\\n",
    "which the data you want displayed on the screen. Notice the quot marks are not displayed when the statement executes.\\\n",
    "The quot marks simply specify the beginning and end of the text that you wish to display.\\\n",
    "It is important to understand that multiple print statements will execute in order from top to bottom.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strings and String Literals\n",
    "Programs almost always works with data of some type. For example, program 2-1 uses the following three pieces of data:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "'Kate Austen'\n",
    "'123 Full Circle Drive'\n",
    "'Asheville, NC 28899'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These three pieces of data are sequences of characters. In programming terms, a sequence of characters that is used as\\\n",
    "data is called a string. When a string appears in the actual code of a program, it is called a string literal.\\\n",
    "String literals must be contained in quote marks. You can enclose string literals in a set of single-quote marks('') or a set of double-quote marks(\"\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Python also allows you to enclose string literals in triple-quotes (either \"\"\" or ''').\\\n",
    "Triple-quoted strings can contain both single and double quotes as part of the string. The following statement shows an example: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"\"\"I'm reading \"Hamlet\" tonight.\"\"\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This statement will print:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Im reading \"Hamlet tonight.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Triple can also be used to surround multiline strings, somthing for which single and double quotes cannot do.\\\n",
    "Here's an example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"\"\"One\n",
    "Two\n",
    "Three\"\"\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The statement will print:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "One \n",
    "Two\n",
    "Three\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comments 2.4\n",
    "Comments are notes of explanation that documents sections of a program. Comments are part the program,\\\n",
    "but the Python interpreter ignores them. Comments are intended for people who may be reading the source code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comments are short noted placed in different parts of a program, explaining how those parts of the program work. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you begin a comment with the # character. When the Python interpreter sees a # character,\\\n",
    "it ignores everything from that character to the end of the line. For example the first 2 lines of code explain the codes purpose:\n",
    "```\n",
    "1 # This program displays a person's\n",
    "2 # name and address\n",
    "3 print('Kate Austen')\n",
    "4 print('123 Full Circle Drive')\n",
    "5 print('Ashville, NC 28899')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Programmers commonly write end-line comments in their.\\\n",
    "An end-line comment is a comment that appears at the end of a line of code.\\\n",
    "It usually explains the statement that appears in that line. Example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "1 print('Kate Austen') # Display the name\n",
    "2 print('123 Full Circle Drive') # Display the address\n",
    "3 print('Ashville, NC 28899') # Display the city, state, and ZIP\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As a beginner programmer, you might be resistant to the idea of liberally writing comments.\\\n",
    "After all, it can seem more productive to write code that actually does somthing!\\\n",
    "It is crucial that you take the extra time to write comments. Comments will almost certainly save\\\n",
    "you and others time in the future whe you have to modify or debug the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables 2.5\n",
    "A variable is a name that represents a value stored in the computer's memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programs usually store data in the computer's memory and perform operation's on that data.\\\n",
    "For example, consider the typical online shopping experience: you browse a website and add\\\n",
    "items you want to purchase to the shopping cart. As you add items to the shopping cart, data about\\\n",
    "the items is stored in memory. Then, when you click the checkout button, a program running on the\\\n",
    "website's computer calculates the cost of all the items you have in your shopping cart, the applicable sales tax,\\\n",
    "shipping costs, and the total of all these charges. When the program performs these calculations,\\\n",
    "it stores the results in the computer's memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programs use variables to access and manipulate data that is stored in memory.\\\n",
    "A variable is a name that represents a value in the computers' memory.\\\n",
    "When a variable represents a value in the computers' memory, we say that the variable references the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating Variables with Assignment Statements\n",
    "You use an assignment statement to create a variable and make it reference a piece of data.\\\n",
    "Here is an example of an assignment statement:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "age = 25\n",
    "```\n",
    "After this statement executes, a variable named age will be created, and it will reference the value 25. \n",
    "\n",
    "An assignment statement is written in the following format:\n",
    "variable = expression\n",
    "\n",
    "the equal sign(=) is known as the assignment operator. In the general format, variable is the name\\\n",
    "of the variable and the expression is the value, or any piece of code that results in a value.\\\n",
    "To experiment with variables, you can type assignment statements in interactive mode, as shown here:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> width = 10\n",
    ">>> length = 5\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "The first statement creates a variable width and assigns it to the value 10 and does the same with length\\\n",
    "and assigns it to 5.\\\n",
    "Nest you use the print function to display the values:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> print(width)\n",
    "10\n",
    ">>> print(length)\n",
    "5\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you pass a variable as an argument to the print function, you do not enclose the variable name in quote marks.\\\n",
    "To demonstrate why look at the follow interactive mode:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> print('width')\n",
    "width\n",
    ">>> print(width)\n",
    "10\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In first statement, you passed 'width' as an argument to the print function, and the function printed the string width.\\\n",
    "In the second, you pass width (With no quote marks) as an argument to the print function, and the function displayed the value.\\\n",
    "\n",
    "In an assignment statement the that is receiving the assignment must appear on the left side of the = operator,\\\n",
    "and it must not be a variable else you will receive an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variable Naming Rules\n",
    "Although you are allowed to make up your own names for variables, you must follow these rules:\\\n",
    "- You cannot use one of Python's keywords as a variable name.\n",
    "- A variable name cannot contain spaces.\n",
    "- The first character must be one of the letters a through z, A through Z, or an underscore character(_).\n",
    "- After the first character you may use the letters a through z or A through Z, the digits 0 through 9, or underscores.\n",
    "- Uppercase and lowercase characters are distinct. This means the variable name ItemsOrdered is not the same as itemsordered.\n",
    "\n",
    "A variables name should reflect its purpose, programmers often find themselves creating names that are made of multiple words.\\\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "grossplay\n",
    "payrate\n",
    "hotdogssoldtoday\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, these names are not easily read by the human eye because the words are not separated.\\\n",
    "And because we can't have spaces in variable names we use underscore(_) to represent the spaces in the variable name.\\\n",
    "Here's an example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "gross_play\n",
    "pay_rate\n",
    "hot_dogs_sold_today\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This naming style is popular among Python programmers, and is the style we will be using consistently.\\\n",
    "There are other styles, such as the camelCase naming convention.\\\n",
    "camelCase names are written in the following manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The variable name begins with lower case letters.\n",
    "- The first character of the second and subsequent words is written in uppercase.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "grossPlay\n",
    "payRate\n",
    "hotDogsDoldToday\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Displaying Multiple Items with the print Function\n",
    "Python allows you to display multiple items with one call to the print function.\\\n",
    "We simply have to separate the items with commas as shown:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1 # This program demonstrates a variable.\n",
    "2 room = 503\n",
    "3 print('I am staying in room number', room)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Displays:\n",
    "```\n",
    "I am staying in room nuber 503\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The argument is the string literal 'I am staying in room number', and the second argument is the room variable.\\\n",
    "When the print function is executed, it displayed the values of the two arguments in the order we passed them to the function.\\\n",
    "Notice the print function automatically printed a space separating the two items,\\\n",
    "and displays them on screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variable Reassignment\n",
    "Variables are called \"variables\" because they can reference different values while a program is running.\\\n",
    "When you assign a value to a variable, the variable will reference that value until you assign it to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a value in memory is no longer referenced by a variable, the Python interpreter automatically removes it\\\n",
    "from memory through a process known as garbage collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of variable reassignment:\n",
    "```\n",
    "# This program demonstrates variale reassignment\n",
    "# Assign a value to the dollars variable\n",
    "dollars = 2.75\n",
    "print('I have', dollars, 'in my account')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Reassign dollars so it referneces\n",
    "# a different value.\n",
    "dollars = 99.95\n",
    "print('But now I have', dollars, 'in my account')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Numeric data types and literals\n",
    "Because different types of numbers are stored and manipulated in different ways,\\\n",
    "Python uses data types to categorize values in memory.\\\n",
    "When an integer is stored in memory, it is classified as int, and when a real number is stored in memory,\\\n",
    "it is classified as float.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at how Python determines the data type of number.\\\n",
    "A number that is written into a program's code is called a numeric literal. \n",
    "\n",
    "When the Python interpreter reads a numeric literal in a program's code, it determines its data type according to the following rules:\n",
    "- A numeric literal that is written as a whole number with no decimal point is considered an int.\n",
    "- A numeric literal that is written with a decimal point is considered a float. \n",
    "\n",
    "As an experiment you can use the built-in type function in interactive mode to determine the data type of value.\\\n",
    "For example, look at the following session:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> type(1)\n",
    "<class 'int'>\n",
    ">>> type(1.0)\n",
    "<class 'float'>\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Storing Strings with str data type\n",
    "Python also has a data type named str, which is used for storing strings in memory.\\\n",
    "This code shows how strings can be assigned to variables:\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Create variables to reference two strings.\n",
    "first_name = 'Kathryn'\n",
    "last_name = 'Marino'\n",
    "\n",
    "# Display thhe values referenced by the variables\n",
    "print(first_name, last_name)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reassigning a Variable to a Different Type\n",
    "Keep in mind that in Python a variable is just a name that refers to a piece of data in memory.\\\n",
    "It is a mechanism that makes it easy for you, the programmer, to store and retrieve data.\\\n",
    "Internally, the Python interpreter keeps track of the variable names that you create and the pieces\\\n",
    "of data to which those variable names refer. Anytime you need to retrieve one of those pieces of data,\\\n",
    "you simply use the variable name that refers to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "After a variable has been assigned an item of one type, it can be reassigned an item of a different type.\\\n",
    "To demonstrate look at the following interactive session:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> x = 99\n",
    ">>> print(x)\n",
    "99\n",
    ">>> x = 'Take me to your leader'\n",
    ">>> print(x)\n",
    "Take me to your leader\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reading Input from the Keyboard\n",
    "Most of the programs that you will write will need to read  input  and then perform an operation on that input.\\\n",
    "In this section, we will discuss a basic input operation: reading data that has been typed on the keyboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the built-in input function  to read the input from the keyboard. The input function reads a piece of data\\\n",
    "that has been entered at the keyboard and returns that piece of data, as a string, back to the program.\\\n",
    "you normally use the input function in an assignment statement that follow this general format:\n",
    "```\n",
    "variable = input(prompt)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "prompt is a string that is displayed on the screen. The string's purpose is to instruct the user\\\n",
    "to enter a value: variable is the name of a variable that references the data that was entered on the keyboard.\\\n",
    "Here's an example of a statement that uses the input function to read data from the keyboard:\n",
    "```\n",
    "name = input('What is your name? ')\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "When this statement executes, the followings happen:\n",
    "- The string 'What is your name? ' is displayed on the screen.\n",
    "- The program pauses and waits for th user to type something on the keyboard and then to press the Enter key\n",
    "- When the enter key is pressed, the data that was typed is returned as a string and assigned to the name variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "To demonstrate look at the following interactive session:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> name = input('What is your name? ')\n",
    "What is your name? Holly\n",
    ">>> print(name)\n",
    "Holly\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Reading Numbers with the input Function\n",
    "The function always the user input as a string, even if the user enters numeric data. For example suppose you call\\\n",
    "the input function, type the number 72, and press the Enter key. The value that is returned from the input is the string '72.\\\n",
    "Fortunately Python has built-in functions that you can use to convert a string to a numeric type.\n",
    "\n",
    "|  Function   |                                                Description                                                |\n",
    "|:-----------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|\n",
    "|  int(item)  |  You can pass an argument to the int() function and it returns the argument's value converted to an int   |\n",
    "| float(item) | You can pass an argument to the float() function and it returns the argument's value converted to a float |\n",
    "\n",
    "For example suppose you are writing a payroll program, and you want to get the number of hours that the user has worked.\\\n",
    "Look at the following code:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "string_value = input('How many hours did you work? ')\n",
    "hours = int(string_value)\n",
    "```\n",
    "The value referenced by string_value is converted to an int and assigned to the hours variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following shows a better way of doing this:\n",
    "```python\n",

    "### Performing Calculations\n",
    "Python has numerous operators that can be used to perform mathematical calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "A programmers tools for performing calculations are math operators. A math expression performs a calculation and gives a value. The following is an example of a simple math expression: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "12 + 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The values on the right and left of the + are called operands, these are the values the + adds together. If you type this expression in interactive mode, you will see that it gives you the value 14:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> 12 + 2\n",
    "14\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables may also be used in a math expression. For example, suppose we have two variables named hours and pay_rate. The following math expression uses * operator to multiply the value referenced by the hours variable by the value referenced by the pay_rate variable:\n",

    "- When the result is negative, it is rounded away from zero to the nearest integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Operator Precedence\n",
    "You can write statements that use complex mathematical expressions involving several operators. The following statement assigns the sum of 17, the variable x, 21, and the variable y to the variable answer:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "answer = 17 + x + 21 + y\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Some expressions are straightforward, however. Consider the following statement:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "outcome = 12.0 + 6.0 / 3.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, the answer can be predicted because Python follow the same order of operations that you learned in math class.\n",
    "First, operations that are enclosed in parentheses are performed first. Then, when two operators share an operand, the operator with the higher precedence is applied first. The precedence of the math operators, highest to lowest, are:\n",
    "1. Exponentation: **\n",
    "2. Multiplication, division, and remainder: * / // %\n",
    "3. Addition and subtraction: + -\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**: There is an exception to the left-to-right rule. When two ** operators share an operand, the operators execute right-to-left. For example,  the expression 2**3**4 is evaluated as 2**(3**4).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Grouping with Parentheses\n",
    "Parts of a mathematical expression may be grouped with parentheses to force some operations to be performed before others. In the following statement, the variable a and b are added together, and their sum is divided by 4.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "result = (a + b) / 4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Exponent Operator\n",
    "Python also provides an exponent operator. Two asterisks written together (**) is the exponent operator, and it's purpose is to raise a number to a power. For example, the following statement raises the length variable to the power of 2 and assigns the result to the area variable:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "area = length ** 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "### Mixed-Type Expressions and Data Type Conversion\n",
    "When you perform an operation on two operands, the data type of the result will depend on the data type of the operands. Python follows these rules when evaluating mathematical expressions:\n",
    "- When an operation is performed  on two int values, the result will be an int.\n",
    "- When an operation is performed on two float values, the result will be a float.\n",
    "- When an operation is performed on an int and a float, the int value is temporarily converted to float and the result will be a float.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at an example of the third situation, which involves mixed-typw expressions:\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_number = 5 * 2.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "When this statement executes, the value 5 will be converted to a float (5.0) then multiplied by 2.0. The result, 10.0, will be assigned to my_number.\n",
    "\n",
    "The int to float conversion takes place in the previous statement happens implicitly. If you need to explicitly perform a conversion, you can use either the int() or float() functions.\n",
    "```\n",
    "fvalue = 2.6\n",
    "ivalue = int(fvalue) (2)\n",
    "evalue = float(ivalue) (2.0)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Breaking Long Statements into Multiple Lines\n",
    "Most programming statements are written on one line. If a programming statement is too long, however, you will not be able to  view all of it in your editor window without scrolling horizontally.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python allows you to break a statement into multiple lines by using line continuation character, which is a backslash(\\). You simply type the backslash character at the point you want to break the statement, the press the enter key.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "result = var1 * 2 + var2 * 3 + \\\n",
    "var3 * 4 + var4 * 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The line continuation character that appears at the end of the first line tells the interpreter that the statement is continued on the next line. Python also allows you to break any part of a statement that is enclosed in parentheses into multiple lines without using the line continuation character. For example, look at the following statement:\n",
    "```\n",
    "print(\"Mondat's sales are\", monday, \n",
    "      \"and Tuesday's sales are\", tuesday, \n",
    "      \"and Wednesday's sales are\", wednesday)\n",

    "### More About Data output\n",
    "In this section you will learn more details about the Python print function, and you'll see techniques for formatting output in specific ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Suppressing the print Function's Ending Newline\n",
    "The print function normally displays a line of output. For eaxample, the following three statements will produce three lines of output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "print('One')\n",
    "print('Two')\n",
    "print('Three')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the statements shown here displays a string and the prints a newline character. If you do not want to start a newline of output when it finishes displaying its output, you can pass the special argument end=' ' to the function, as shown in following code:\n",
    "```\n",
    "print('One', end=' ')\n",
    "print('Two', end=' ')\n",
    "print('Three')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice in the first two statements, the argument end=' ' is passed to print function. This specifies that the print function should print a space instead of a newline character at the end of its output. Here's the output of these statements:\n",
    "```\n",
    "One Two Three\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specifying an Item Separator\n",
    "When multiple arguments are passed to a print function, they are automatically separated by a space they are displayed on the screen. HEre is an example, demonstrated in interactive mode:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> Print('One', 'Two', 'Three')\n",
    "One Two Three\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't want a space print printed between the items, you can pass the argument sep='' to the print function:\n",

    "OneTwoThree\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",

    "### Escape Characters\n",
    "An escape is a special character that is preceded with a backslash(\\), appearing inside a string literal. for example, \\n is the newline escape character. When the \\n escape character is printed, it isn't displayed on the screen. Instead, it causes output to advance to the next line. For example, look at the following:\n",
    "```\n",
    "print('One\\nTwo\\nThree')\n",

    "Thurs   Fri     Sat\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Displaying Multiple Items with the + operator\n",
    "Earlier you saw that the + operator is used to add two numbers. When thhe + operator is used with two strings, however, it performs string concatenation. This means that it appends one string to another. For example, look at the following:\n",
    "```\n",
    "print('This is' + 'one string.')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This statement will print:\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is one string.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formatting Numbers\n",
    "you might not always be happy with the way that numbers, especially floating-point numbers, are displayed on the screen. when a floating-point number is displayed by the print function, it can appear with up to 12 significant digits. Because the program displays a dollar amount, it would be nice to see the amount rounded to two decimal places. Fortunately, Python gives us a way to do just that, and more, with the built-in format function. When you call the built-in format function, you pass two arguments to the function: a numeric value and a format specifier. The format specifier is a string that contains special characters specifying how the numeric value should be formatted. Let's look at an example here:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> format(12345.6789, '.2f')\n",
    "12345.68\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "- The .2 specifies the precision. It indicates that we want to round the number to two decimal places.\n",
    "- The f specifies that the data type of the number we are formatting is a floating-point number.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formatting in Scientific Notation\n",
    "if you prefer to display floating-point numbers in scientific notation, you can use the letter e or E instead of f.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inserting Comma Separators\n",
    "If you want the number to be formatted with the comma separators, you can insert a comma into the format specifier, as show here:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> format(12345.6789, ',.2f')\n",
    "12,345.68\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an example that specifies the comma separator, but does not specify precision:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> format(12345.6789, ',f')\n",
    "12,345.6789000\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Specifying a Minimum Field Width\n",
    "The format specifier can also include a minimum field width, which is the minimum number of spaces that should be used to display the value. The follow example prints the number in a field that 12 spaces wide:\n",
    "```\n",
    "(With comma)\n",
    ">>> print('The number is',format(12345.6789, '12,.2f'))\n",
    "The number is 12,345.68\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "---------------------------------------------------------\n",
    "```\n",
    "(Without comma)\n",
    ">>> print('The number is',format(12345.6789, '12.2f'))\n",
    "The number is        12345.68\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "### Formatting a Floating-Point Number as a Percentage\n",
    "Instead of using f as the type disignataor, you can use the % symbol to format a floating-point number as a percentage. The % symbol causes the number to be multiplied and displayed with a % sign following it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formatting integers\n",
    "You can use the format function to format integers. There are two differences to keep in mind when writing a format spcifier  that will be used to format integers:\n",
    "- You use d as the type designator\n",
    "- You cannot specify precision\n",
    "\n",
    "### Named Constants\n",
    "A named constant is a name that represents a value that cannot be changed during the program's execution.\n",
    "Imagine for a moment that you are a programmer working at a bank. You are  updating an existing program that calculates data pertaining to loans, and you see the following:\n",
    "```\n",
    "amount =  balnce * 0.069\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Because someone else wrote the program, you aren't sure what the number 0.069 is. It appears to be an interest number, but it could be a number that is used to calculate some sort of fee. You simply can't determine the purpose of the number 0.069 by reading this line of code. This is an example of magica number. A magic number is an unexplained value that appears in a program's code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Magic numbers can be problematic and for a number of reason. These problems can be addressed by using named constants to represent magic numbers. A named constant is a name that represents a value that does not change during the programs' execution. The following is how we will declare named constants in code:\n",
    "```\n",
    "INTERSEST_RATE = 0.069\n",
