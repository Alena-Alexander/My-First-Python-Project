    "### Designing a Program 2.1\n",
    "\n",
    "Programs must be carefully designed before they are written.\\\n",
    "During the design process, programmers use tools such as pseudocode and\\\n",
    "flowcharts to create models of programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Program Development Cycle\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of creating a program that works correctly typically requires the\\\n",
    "five phases shown. The process is known as the program development cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Program Development Cycle\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Design the program**. Tons of professional programmers will tell you that a program\\\n",
    "should be designed carefully before the code is written. When writing a program you\\\n",
    "should start by creating a design of the program, and there are plenty of ways to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Write the Code**. After designing the program, then you begin writing code in a\\\n",
    "high-level language. While remembering to follow the syntax rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Correct Syntax Errors**. If the program contains a syntax error, the compiler\\\n",
    "or interpreter will display an error message indicting what the error is. Once the\\\n",
    "error are corrected the code is able to be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Test the Program**. Once the code is in an executable form, it is then tested\\\n",
    "to determine whether any logic errors exist. A logic error is a mistake that doesn't\\\n",
    "stop the program form running, but causes it to produce result.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Correct Logic Errors**. If the program produces the incorrect results, the\\\n",
    "programmer debugs the code. Debugs means that the programmer finds and corrects logic\\\n",
    "errors in the program. Sometimes during the process the programmer discovers that the programs'\\\n",
    "original design must be changed. in this event, the program development cycle starts over and\\\n",
    "continues until no errors can be found.\n",
    "\n",
    "### More About the Design Process\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of designing a program is arguably the most important part of the cycle.\\\n",
    "You can think of a programs' design as its foundation. If you build a house on a poorly\\\n",
    "constructed foundation, eventually you'll find yourself doing alot of work to fix the house.\\\n",
    "So if your program is designed poorly eventually you will find yourself doing alot\n",
    "of work to fix it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of designing a program can be summarized in the following two steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Understanding the task that the program is to perform.\n",
    "2. Determine the steps that must be taken to perform this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understand the Task That the Program Is to Perform\n",
    "\n",
    "It is essential that you understand what a program is supposed to do before\\\n",
    "designing it. Typically, a professional programmer gains this understanding by\\\n",
    "working directly with customer. We use the term customer to describe the person, group,\\\n",
    "or company asking you to write a program, or in a traditional sense someone who is paying\\\n",
    "you to write a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the interviews, the customer will describe the task that the program should perform,\\\n",
    "and programmer will ask questions to uncover as many details as possible about the task.\\\n",
    "A follow-up interview is usually needed because customers rarely mention everything\\\n",
    "they want the program to do, and programmers often think of additional questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The programmer studies the information that was gathered from the during the\\\n",
    "interviews and creates a list of different software requirements. A software requirement\\\n",
    "is simply a single task that the program \n",
    "must perform in order to satisfy the customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Determine the Steps That Must be Taken to Perform the Task\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you understand the task that the program will perform, you begin by breaking down\\\n",
    "the to task into a series of steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example suppose someone asks you how to boil water, you break the task down into\\\n",
    "a series of steps as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pour the desired amount of water into a pot.\n",
    "2. Put pot on a stove burner.\n",
    "3. Turn the burner to high.\n",
    "4. Watch the water until you see large bubbles rapidly rising. When this happens,\n",
    "5. the water is boiling.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an example of an algorithm, which a set of steps that must be taken to\\\n",
    "perform a task.\n",
    "\n",
    "A programmer breaks down the task that the program is meant to perform(As you would to\\\n",
    "explain boiling water). An algorythm is created, which is a list of all the logical steps\\\n",
    "that must be taken. For example suppose you have been asked to write a program to calculate\\\n",
    "and display the gross pay for an hourly paid employee. Here are the steps to take:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Get the number of hours worked.\n",
    "2. get the hourly pay rate.\n",
    "3. Multiply the number of hours worked by the hourly pay rate.\n",
    "4. Display the result of the calculation that was performed in step 3.\n",
    "Then the steps in the list would ofc have to code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pseudocode\n",
    "\n",
    "Because small mistakes in code can cause syntax errors, programmers find it helpful\\\n",
    "write programs in pseudocode before they write the actual code. Pseudocode is fake code,\\\n",
    "it is an informal language that has no syntax rules and is not meant to be compiled or executed.\\\n",
    "Instead, programmers use pseudocode to create models, or \"mock-ups,\" of programs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because programmers don't have to worry about syntax errors while writing pseudocode,\\\n",
    "they can focus all their attention on the programs design.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Flowcharts\n",
    "\n",
    "Flowcharting is another tool programmers use to design programs.\\\n",
    "A Flowchart is a diagram that graphically depicts the steps that\\\n",
    "take place in a program. There are three symbols in a flowchart: Ovals,\\\n",
    "Parallelograms, and a rectangle. Each of these represent a step in the program,\\\n",
    "as described:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The ovals, which appear at the top or bottom of the chart, are called terminal\\\n",
    "symbols. The Start terminal symbol marks the programs starting point, and the\\\n",
    "End terminal symbol marks the programs ending point.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The parallelograms are uses as input symbols and output symbols. They represent\\\n",
    "steps in which the program reads inputs or displays output.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rectangles are used  as processing symbols. The represent steps in which the program\\\n",
    "performs some process on data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input, Processing, and Output\n",
    "\n",
    "Input is data that the program receives. When a program receives data, it usually processes\\\n",
    "it by performing some operation on it. \n",
    "\n",
    "The result of the operation is sent out of the program as output\n",
    "\n",
    "Computer programs typically perform the following three-step process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Input is received.\n",
    "2. Some process is performed on the input.\n",
    "3. Output is produced.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input is any data that the program receives while it is running. one common form of input\\\n",
    "is data that is typed on the keyboard. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once input is received, some process, such as a mathematics calculation is done to it.\\\n",
    "The result of the process is sent out as an output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Displaying Output with the print Function\n",
    "\n",
    "You use the print function to display output in a python program. \n",
    "\n",
    "A function is piece of a prewritten code that performs an operation.\\\n",
    "Python has numerous built-in functions that perform various operations.\\\n",
    "The most fundamental built-in function is the print function.\\\n",
    "Here is an example that executes a print statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print('Hello world')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In interactive mode if you typed this statement, the message Hello world would be display\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> print('Hello world')\n",
    "Hello world\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When programmers execute a function, they say they're calling the function. When\\\n",
    "you call the print function, you type the word print, followed by a set of parentheses.\\\n",
    "Inside the parentheses, you type an argument, which the data you want displayed on the\\\n",
    "screen. Notice the quot marks are not displayed when the statement executes. The quot marks\\\n",
    "simply specify the beginning and end of the text that you wish to display. It is important\\\n",
    "to understand that multiple print statements will execute in order from top to bottom.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strings and String Literals\n",
    "\n",
    "Programs almost always works with data of some type. For example, program 2-1 uses the\\\n",
    "following three pieces of data:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "'Kate Austen'\n",
    "'123 Full Circle Drive'\n",
    "'Asheville, NC 28899'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These three pieces of data are sequences of characters. In programming terms, a sequence\\\n",
    "of characters that is used as data is called a string. When a string appears in the actual\\\n",
    "code of a program, it is called a string literal.\n",
    "\n",
    "String literals must be contained in quote marks. You can enclose string literals in a\\\n",
    "set of single-quote marks('') or a set of double-quote marks(\"\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Python also allows you to enclose string literals in triple-quotes (either \"\"\" or ''').\\\n",
    "Triple-quoted strings can contain both single and double quotes as part of the string.\\\n",
    "The following statement shows an example: \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"\"\"I'm reading \"Hamlet\" tonight.\"\"\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This statement will print:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Im reading \"Hamlet tonight.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Triple can also be used to surround multiline strings, somthing for which single and\\\n",
    "double quotes cannot do. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(\"\"\"One\n",
    "Two\n",
    "Three\"\"\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The statement will print:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "One \n",
    "Two\n",
    "Three\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comments 2.4\n",
    "Comments are notes of explanation that documents sections of a program. Comments\\\n",
    "are part the program, but the Python interpreter ignores them. Comments are intended\\\n",
    "for people who may be reading the source code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comments are short noted placed in different parts of a program, explaining how those\\\n",
    "parts of the program work. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you begin a comment with the # character. When the Python interpreter sees\\\n",
    "a # character, it ignores everything from that character to the end of the line.\\\n",
    "For example the first 2 lines of code explain the codes purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1 # This program displays a person's\n",
    "2 # name and address\n",
    "3 print('Kate Austen')\n",
    "4 print('123 Full Circle Drive')\n",
    "5 print('Ashville, NC 28899')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Programmers commonly write end-line comments in their.\\\n",
    "An end-line comment is a comment that appears at the end of a line of code.\\\n",
    "It usually explains the statement that appears in that line. Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1 print('Kate Austen') # Display the name\n",
    "2 print('123 Full Circle Drive') # Display the address\n",
    "3 print('Ashville, NC 28899') # Display the city, state, and ZIP\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As a beginner programmer, you might be resistant to the idea of liberally writing comments.\\\n",
    "After all, it can seem more productive to write code that actually does somthing!\\\n",
    "It is crucial that you take the extra time to write comments. Comments will almost certainly save\\\n",
    "you and others time in the future whe you have to modify or debug the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables 2.5\n",
    "\n",
    "A variable is a name that represents a value stored in the computer's memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programs usually store data in the computer's memory and perform operation's on\\\n",
    "that data. For example, consider the typical online shopping experience: you browse a\\\n",
    "website and add items you want to purchase to the shopping cart. As you add items to the\\\n",
    "shopping cart, data about the items is stored in memory. Then, when you click the checkout\\\n",
    "button, a program running on the website's computer calculates the cost of all the items you\\\n",
    "have in your shopping cart, the applicable sales tax, shipping costs, and the total of all these\\\n",
    "charges. When the program performs these calculations, it stores the results in the\\\n",
    "computer's memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programs use variables to access and manipulate data that is stored in memory.\\\n",
    "A variable is a name that represents a value in the computers' memory.\\\n",
    "When a variable represents a value in the computers' memory, we say that the variable\\\n",
    "references the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating Variables with Assignment Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "You use an assignment statement to create a variable and make it reference a\\\n",
    "piece of data. Here is an example of an assignment statement:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "age = 25\n",
    "```\n",
    "After this statement executes, a variable named age will be created, and it\\\n",
    "will reference the value 25. \n",
    "\n",
    "An assignment statement is written in the following format:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "variable = expression\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "the equal sign(=) is known as the assignment operator. In the general format,\\\n",
    "variable is the name of the variable and the expression is the value, or any\\\n",
    "piece of code that results in a value. To experiment with variables, you can type\\\n",
    "assignment statements in interactive mode, as shown here:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> width = 10\n",
    ">>> length = 5\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "The first statement creates a variable width and assigns it to the value 10 and does\\\n",
    "the same with length and assigns it to 5. Nest you use the print function to\\\n",
    "display the values:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> print(width)\n",
    "10\n",
    ">>> print(length)\n",
    "5\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you pass a variable as an argument to the print function, you do not enclose the\\\n",
    "variable name in quote marks. To demonstrate why look at the follow interactive mode:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> print('width')\n",
    "width\n",
    ">>> print(width)\n",
    "10\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In first statement, you passed 'width' as an argument to the print function, and the\\\n",
    "Function printed the string width.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the second, you pass width (With no quote marks) as an argument to the print function, and\\\n",
    "the function displayed the value. \n",
    "\n",
    "In an assignment statement the that is receiving the assignment must appear on the left side\\\n",
    "of the = operator, and it must not be a variable else you will receive an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variable Naming Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "Although you are allowed to make up your own names for variables, you must follow these rules: \n",
    "\n",
    "- You cannot use one of Python's keywords as a variable name.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A variable name cannot contain spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first character must be one of the letters a through z, A through Z, or an\\\n",
    "underscore character(_).\n",
    "\n",
    "- After the first character you may use the letters a through z or A through Z, the digits\\\n",
    "0 through 9, or underscores.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Uppercase and lowercase characters are distinct. This means the variable name\\\n",
    "ItemsOrdered is not the same as itemsordered.\n",
    "\n",
    "A variables name should reflect its purpose, programmers often find themselves creating\n",
    "names that are made of multiple words. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "grossplay\n",
    "payrate\n",
    "hotdogssoldtoday\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, these names are not easily read by the human eye because the\\\n",
    "words are not separated. And because we can't have spaces in variable names we\\\n",
    "use underscore(_) to represent the spaces in the variable name. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "gross_play\n",
    "pay_rate\n",
    "hot_dogs_sold_today\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This naming style is popular among Python programmers, and is the style we\\\n",
    "will be using consistently. There are other styles, such as the camelCase\\\n",
    "naming convention. camelCase names are written in the following manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The variable name begins with lower case letters.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The first character of the second and subsequent words is\\\n",
    "written in uppercase.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "grossPlay\n",
    "payRate\n",
    "hotDogsDoldToday\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Displaying Multiple Items with the print Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Python allows you to display multiple items with one call to\\\n",
    "the print function. We simply have to separate the items with commas as shown:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1 # This program demonstrates a variable.\n",
    "2 room = 503\n",
    "3 print('I am staying in room number', room)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Displays:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "I am staying in room nuber 503\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The argument is the string literal 'I am staying in room number', and the second\\\n",
    "argument is the room variable. When the print function is executed, it displayed\\\n",
    "the values of the two arguments in the order we passed them to the function.\\\n",
    "Notice the print function automatically printed a space separating the two items,\\\n",
    "and displays them on screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variable Reassignment\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables are called \"variables\" because they can reference different values while a\\\n",
    "program is running. When you assign a value to a variable, the variable will reference\\\n",
    "that value until you assign it to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a value in memory is no longer referenced by a variable, the Python interpreter\\\n",
    "automatically removes it from memory through a process known as garbage collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example of variable reassignment:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# This program demonstrates variale reassignment\n",
    "# Assign a value to the dollars variable\n",
    "dollars = 2.75\n",
    "print('I have', dollars, 'in my account')\n",
    "\n",
    "# Reassign dollars so it referneces\n",
    "# a different value.\n",
    "dollars = 99.95\n",
    "print('But now I have', dollars, 'in my account')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Numeric data types and literals\n",
    "\n",
    "Because different types of numbers are stored and manipulated in different ways\\\n",
    "Python uses data types to categorize values in memory. When an integer is stored in memory,\\\n",
    "it is classified as int, and when a real number is stored in memory, it is classified as float.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at how Python determines the data type of number.\\\n",
    "A number that is written into a program's code is called a numeric literal. \n",
    "\n",
    "When the Python interpreter reads a numeric literal in a program's code, it determines\\\n",
    "its data type according to the following rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A numeric literal that is written as a whole number with no decimal point is\\\n",
    "considered an int.\n",
    "- \n",
    "- A numeric literal that is written with a decimal point is considered a float. \n",
    "\n",
    "As an experiment you can use the built-in type function in interactive mode to determine\\\n",
    "the data type of value. For example, look at the following session:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> type(1)\n",
    "<class 'int'>\n",
    ">>> type(1.0)\n",
    "<class 'float'>\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Storing Strings with str data type\n",
    "\n",
    "Python also has a data type named str, which is used for storing strings in memory.\\\n",
    "This code shows how strings can be assigned to variables:\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Create variables to reference two strings.\n",
    "first_name = 'Kathryn'\n",
    "last_name = 'Marino'\n",
    "\n",
    "# Display thhe values referenced by the variables\n",
    "print(first_name, last_name)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reassigning a Variable to a Different Type\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that in Python a variable is just a name that refers to a piece of data in memory.\\\n",
    "It is a mechanism that makes it easy for you, the programmer, to store and retrieve data.\\\n",
    "Internally, the Python interpreter keeps track of the variable names that you create and the pieces\\\n",
    "of data to which those variable names refer. Anytime you need to retrieve one of those pieces of data,\\\n",
    "you simply use the variable name that refers to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "After a variable has been assigned an item of one type, it can be reassigned an item of a\\\n",
    "different type. To demonstrate look at the following interactive session:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> x = 99\n",
    ">>> print(x)\n",
    "99\n",
    ">>> x = 'Take me to your leader'\n",
    ">>> print(x)\n",
    "Take me to your leader\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reading Input from the Keyboard\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the programs that you will write will need to read  input  and then perform an\\\n",
    "operation on that input. In this section, we will discuss a basic input operation:\\\n",
    "reading data that has been typed on the keyboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the built-in input function  to read the input from the keyboard. The input\\\n",
    "function reads a piece of data that has been entered at the keyboard and returns that\\\n",
    "piece of data, as a string, back to the program. You normally use the input function in\\\n",
    "an assignment statement that follow this general format:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "variable = input(prompt)\n",
    "```\n",

    "too long,however, you will not be able to  view all of it in your editor window without\\\n",
    "scrolling horizontally.\n",

    "### Suppressing the print Function's Ending Newline\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice in the first two statements, the argument end=' ' is passed to print function. This\\\n",

    "\n",
    "Earlier you saw that the + operator is used to add two numbers. When the + operator is\\\n",
    "used with two strings, however, it performs string concatenation. This means that it appends\\\n",
    "one string to another. For example, look at the following:\n",

    "### Formatting Numbers\n",
    "\n",
    "you might not always be happy with the way that numbers, especially floating-point numbers,\\\n",
    "are displayed on the screen. when a floating-point number is displayed by the print function,\\\n",
    "it can appear with up to 12 significant digits. Because the program displays a dollar amount,\\\n",
    "it would be nice to see the amount rounded to two decimal places. Fortunately, Python gives us\\\n",
    "a way to do just that, and more, with the built-in format function. When you call the built-in\\\n",
    "format function, you pass two arguments to the function: a numeric value and a format specifier.\\\n",
    "The format specifier is a string that contains special characters specifying how the numeric\\\n",
    "value should be formatted. Let's look at an example here:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> format(12345.6789, '.2f')\n",
    "12345.68\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "- The .2 specifies the precision. It indicates that we want to round the number\\\n",
    "to two decimal places.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The f specifies that the data type of the number we are formatting is a\\\n",
    "floating-point number.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formatting in Scientific Notation\n",
    "\n",
    "if you prefer to display floating-point numbers in scientific notation, you can use the\\\n",
    "letter e or E instead of f.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inserting Comma Separators\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want the number to be formatted with the comma separators, you can insert a comma\\\n",
    "into the format specifier, as show here:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> format(12345.6789, ',.2f')\n",

    "field that 12 spaces wide:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",

    "### Named Constants\n",
    "\n",
    "A named constant is a name that represents a value that cannot be changed during\\\n",
    "the program's execution. Imagine for a moment that you are a programmer working\\\n",
    "at a bank. You are updating an existing program that calculates data pertaining\\\n",
    "to loans, and you see the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "amount =  balnce * 0.069\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Because someone else wrote the program, you aren't sure what the number 0.069 is. It\\\n",
    "appears to be an interest number, but it could be a number that is used to calculate\\\n",
    "some sort of fee. You simply can't determine the purpose of the number 0.069 by reading\\\n",
    "this line of code. This is an example of magica number. A magic number is an unexplained\\\n",
    "value that appears in a program's code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Magic numbers can be problematic and for a number of reason. These problems can be addressed\\\n",
    "by using named constants to represent magic numbers. A named constant is a name that represents\\\n",
    "a value that does not change during the programs' execution. The following is how we will\n",
    "declare named constants in code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "INTERSEST_RATE = 0.069\n",
    "```\n",
