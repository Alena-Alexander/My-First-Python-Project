    "### Designing a Program 2.1\n",
    "Programs must be carefully designed before they are written. During the design process,\\\n",
    "programmers use tools such as pseudocode and flowcharts to create models of programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Program Development Cycle\n",
    "The process of creating a program that works correctly typically requires the five phases shown.\\\n",
    "The process is known as the program development cycle.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Program Development Cycle\n",
    "- **Design the program**. Tons of professional programmers will tell you that a program should be designed\\\n",
    "carefully before the code is written. When writing a program you should start by creating a design of the program,\\\n",
    "and there are plenty of ways to do so.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Write the Code**. After designing the program, then you begin writing code in a high-level language.\\\n",
    "While remembering to follow the syntax rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Correct Syntax Errors**. If the program contains a syntax error, the compiler or interpreter will display\\\n",
    "an error message indicting what the error is. Once the error are corrected the code is able to be executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Test the Program**. Once the code is in an executable form, it is then tested to determine whether any logic\\\n",
    "errors exist. A logic error is a mistake that doesn't stop the program form running, but causes it to produce result.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Correct Logic Errors**. If the program produces the incorrect results, the programmer debugs the code.\\\n",
    "Debugs means that the programmer finds and corrects logic errors in the program. Sometimes during the process the programmer\\\n",
    "- discovers that the programs' original design must be changed. in this event, the program development cycle starts over and\\\n",
    "- continues until no errors can be found.\n",
    "\n",
    "### More About the Design Process\n",
    "The process of designing a program is arguably the most important part of the cycle.\\\n",
    "You can think of a programs' design as its foundation. If you build a house on a poorly constructed foundation,\\\n",
    "eventually you'll find yourself doing alot of work to fix the house.\\\n",
    "So if your program is designed poorly eventually you will find yourself doing alot of work to fix it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of designing a program can be summarized in the following two steps:\n",
    "1. Understanding the task that the program is to perform.\n",
    "2. Determine the steps that must be taken to perform this task.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understand the Task That the Program Is to Perform\n",
    "it is essential that you understand what a program is supposed to do before designing it.\\\n",
    "Typically, a professional programmer gains this understanding by working directly with customer.\\\n",
    "We use the term customer to describe the person, group, or company asking you to write a program,\\\n",
    "or in a traditional sense someone who is paying you to write a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the interviews, the customer will describe the task that the program should perform,\\\n",
    "and programmer will ask questions to uncover as many details as possible about the task.\\\n",
    "A follow-up interview is usually needed because customers rarely mention everything they want the program to do,\\\n",
    "and programmers often think of additional questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The programmer studies the information that was gathered from the  during the interviews and creates a\\\n",
    "list of different software requirements. A software requirement is simply a single task that the program\\\n",
    "must perform in order to satisfy the customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Determine the Steps That Must be Taken to Perform the Task\n",
    "Once you understand the task that the program will perform, you begin by breaking down the to task into a series of steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example suppose someone asks you how to boil water, you break the task down into a series of steps as follows:\n",
    "1. Pour the desired amount of water into a pot.\n",
    "2. Put pot on a stove burner.\n",
    "3. Turn the burner to high.\n",
    "4. Watch the water until you see large bubbles rapidly rising. When this happens, the water is boiling.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an example of an algorithm, which a set of steps that must be taken to perform a task.\n",
    "\n",
    "A programmer breaks down the task that the program is meant to perform(As you would to explain boiling water).\\\n",
    "An algorythm is created, which is a list of all the logical steps that must be taken. For example(in terms of software)\\\n",
    "suppose you have been asked to write a program to calculate and display the gross pay for an hourly paid employee.\\\n",
    "Here are the steps to take:\n",
    "1. Get the number of hours worked.\n",
    "2. get the hourly pay rate.\n",
    "3. Multiply the number of hours worked by the hourly pay rate.\n",
    "4. Display the result of the calculation that was performed in step 3.\n",
    "Then the steps in the list would ofc have to code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pseudocode\n",
    "Because small mistakes in code can cause syntax errors, programmers find it helpful write programs in\\\n",
    "pseudocode before they write the actual code. Pseudocode is fake code, it is an informal language that has no syntax\\\n",
    "rules and is not meant to be compiled or executed. Instead, programmers use pseudocode to create models, or \"mock-ups,\" of programs.\\\n",
    "Because programmers don't have to worry about syntax errors while writing pseudocode,\\\n",
    "they can focus all their attention on the programs design.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Flowcharts\n",
    "Flowcharting is another tool programmers use to design programs.\\\n",
    "A Flowchart is a diagram that graphically depicts the steps that take place in a program.\\\n",
    "There are three symbols in a flowchart: Ovals, Parallelograms, and a rectangle.\\\n",
    "Each of these represent a step in the program, as described:\n",
    "- The ovals, which appear at the top or bottom of the chart, are called terminal symbols.\n",
    "The Start terminal symbol marks the programs starting point, and the End terminal symbol marks the programs ending point.\n",
    "- The parallelograms are uses as input symbols and output symbols. They represent steps in which the program reads inputs or displays output.\n",
    "- Rectangles are used  as processing symbols. The represent steps in which the program performs some process on data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input, Processing, and Output\n",
    "Input is data that the program receives. When a program receives data, it usually processes it by performing some operation on it.\\\n",
    "The result of the operation is sent out of the program as output\n",
    "\n",
    "Computer programs typically perform the following three-step process:\n",
    "1. Input is received.\n",
    "2. Some process is performed on the input.\n",
    "3. Output is produced.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input is any data that the program receives while it is running. one common form of input is data that is typed on the keyboard.\\\n",
    "Once input is received, some process, such as a mathematics calculation is done to it.\\\n",
    "The result of the process is sent out as an output.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Displaying Output with the print Function\n",
    "You use the print function to display output in a python program. \n",
    "\n",
    "A function is piece of a prewritten code that performs an operation.\\\n",
    "Python has numerous built-in functions that perform various operations.\\\n",
    "The most fundamental built-in function is the print function.\\\n",
    "Here is an example that executes a print statement:\n",
    "```\n",
    "print('Hello world')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In interactive mode if you typed this statement, the message Hello world would be display\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> print('Hello world')\n",
    "Hellow world\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When programmers execute a function, they say they're calling the function. When you call the print function,\\\n",
    "you type the word print, followed by a set of parentheses. Inside the parentheses, you type an argument,\\\n",
    "which the data you want displayed on the screen. Notice the quot marks are not displayed when the statement executes.\\\n",
    "The quot marks simply specify the beginning and end of the text that you wish to display.\\\n",
    "It is important to understand that multiple print statements will execute in order from top to bottom.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strings and String Literals\n",
    "Programs almost always works with data of some type. For example, program 2-1 uses the following three pieces of data:\n",
    "```\n",
    "'Kate Austen'\n",
    "'123 Full Circle Drive'\n",
    "'Asheville, NC 28899'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "These three pieces of data are sequences of characters. In programming terms, a sequence of characters that is used as\\\n",
    "data is called a string. When a string appears in the actual code of a program, it is called a string literal.\\\n",
    "String literals must be contained in quote marks. You can enclose string literals in a set of single-quote marks('') or a set of double-quote marks(\"\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Python also allows you to enclose string literals in triple-quotes (either \"\"\" or ''').\\\n",
    "Triple-quoted strings can contain both single and double quotes as part of the string. The following statement shows an example: \n",
    "```\n",
    "print(\"\"\"I'm reading \"Hamlet\" tonight.\"\"\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This statement will print:\n",
    "```\n",
    "I'm reading \"Hamlet\" tonight.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Triple can also be used to surround multiline strings, somthing for which single and double quotes cannot do.\\\n",
    "Here's an example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "print(\"\"\"One\n",
    "Two\n",
    "Three\"\"\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The statement will print:\n",
    "```\n",
    "One \n",
    "Two\n",
    "Three\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Comments 2.4\n",
    "Comments are notes of explanation that documents sections of a program. Comments are part the program,\\\n",
    "but the Python interpreter ignores them. Comments are intended for people who may be reading the source code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comments are short noted placed in different parts of a program, explaining how those parts of the program work. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, you begin a comment with the # character. When the Python interpreter sees a # character,\\\n",
    "it ignores everything from that character to the end of the line. For example the first 2 lines of code explain the codes purpose:\n",
    "```\n",
    "1 # This program displays a person's\n",
    "2 # name and address\n",
    "3 print('Kate Austen')\n",
    "4 print('123 Full Circle Drive')\n",
    "5 print('Ashville, NC 28899')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Programmers commonly write end-line comments in their.\\\n",
    "An end-line comment is a comment that appears at the end of a line of code.\\\n",
    "It usually explains the statement that appears in that line. Example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "1 print('Kate Austen') # Display the name\n",
    "2 print('123 Full Circle Drive') # Display the address\n",
    "3 print('Ashville, NC 28899') # Display the city, state, and ZIP\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As a beginner programmer, you might be resistant to the idea of liberally writing comments.\\\n",
    "After all, it can seem more productive to write code that actually does somthing!\\\n",
    "It is crucial that you take the extra time to write comments. Comments will almost certainly save\\\n",
    "you and others time in the future whe you have to modify or debug the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Variables 2.5\n",
    "A variable is a name that represents a value stored in the computer's memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programs usually store data in the computer's memory and perform operation's on that data.\\\n",
    "For example, consider the typical online shopping experience: you browse a website and add\\\n",
    "items you want to purchase to the shopping cart. As you add items to the shopping cart, data about\\\n",
    "the items is stored in memory. Then, when you click the checkout button, a program running on the\\\n",
    "website's computer calculates the cost of all the items you have in your shopping cart, the applicable sales tax,\\\n",
    "shipping costs, and the total of all these charges. When the program performs these calculations,\\\n",
    "it stores the results in the computer's memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Programs use variables to access and manipulate data that is stored in memory.\\\n",
    "A variable is a name that represents a value in the computers' memory.\\\n",
    "When a variable represents a value in the computers' memory, we say that the variable references the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating Variables with Assignment Statements\n",
    "You use an assignment statement to create a variable and make it reference a piece of data.\\\n",
    "Here is an example of an assignment statement:\n",
    "```\n",
    "age = 25\n",
    "```\n",
    "After this statement executes, a variable named age will be created, and it will reference the value 25. \n",
    "\n",
    "An assignment statement is written in the following format:\n",
    "variable = expression\n",
    "\n",
    "the equal sign(=) is known as the assignment operator. In the general format, variable is the name\\\n",
    "of the variable and the expression is the value, or any piece of code that results in a value.\\\n",
    "To experiment with variables, you can type assignment statements in interactive mode, as shown here:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> width = 10\n",
    ">>> length = 5\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "The first statement creates a variable width and assigns it to the value 10 and does the same with length\\\n",
    "and assigns it to 5.\\\n",
    "Nest you use the print function to display the values:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> print(width)\n",
    "10\n",
    ">>> print(length)\n",
    "5\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you pass a variable as an argument to the print function, you do not enclose the variable name in quote marks.\\\n",
    "To demonstrate why look at the follow interactive mode:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> print('width')\n",
    "width\n",
    ">>> print(width)\n",
    "10\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In first statement, you passed 'width' as an argument to the print function, and the function printed the string width.\\\n",
    "In the second, you pass width (With no quote marks) as an argument to the print function, and the function displayed the value.\\\n",
    "\n",
    "In an assignment statement the that is receiving the assignment must appear on the left side of the = operator,\\\n",
    "and it must not be a variable else you will receive an error.\n",
    "\n",
