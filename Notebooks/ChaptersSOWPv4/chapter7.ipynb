    "# Lists and Tuples\n",
    "### Sequences 7.1\n",
    "**Concept**: A sequence is an object that holds multiple items of data, stored one after the other. You can perform operations on sequence to examine and manipulate the items stored in them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction to Lists 7.2\n",
    "**Concept**: A lists is an object that contains multiple data types. Lists are mutable which means there types can be changed during a program's execution. Lists are dynamic structures, meaning that items can be added to them or removed from them. You can use indexing slicing and various other methods to work with lists in a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each item that is stored in a list is called an element. Here's a statement that creates a list of integer:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "even_numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n",
    "```\n",
    "The items that are enclosed in brackets and separated by commas are the lists elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is another example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "names = ['Molly', 'Steven', 'Will', 'Alicia', 'Adriana']\n",
    "```\n",
    "This statement creates a lists of five strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "A list can hold items of different types, as shown in the following example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "info = ['Alicia', 27, 1550.87]\n",
    "```\n",
    "This statement creates a list containing a string, an integer, and a floating-point number.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can print a use the print function to display an entire list, as shown here:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20]\n",
    "print(numbers)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The print function will display them like this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[5, 10, 15, 20]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has built-in list() function that can convert certain objects to lists. You can use a statement such as that following to convert the range function's iterable object to a list:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = list(range(5))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is another example: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = list(range(1, 10, 2))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This statement will assign [1, 3, 5, 7, 9] to the number variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Repetition Operator\n",
    "When an operand on the left side of the * symbol is a sequence and the operand on the left side is a integer, it becomes a repetition operator. The repetition operator makes multiple copies of a list and joins them all together. Here's the general format:\n",
    "```\n",
    "list * n\n",
    "```\n",
    "list is the list and n is the number of copies to make the following interactive session demonstrates:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> number = [0] * 5\n",
    ">>> print(number)\n",
    "[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n",
    ">>> \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's another demonstration:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> numbers = [1, 2, 3] * 3\n",
    ">>> print(numbers)\n",
    "[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]\n",
    ">>> \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Iterating over a List with the for Loop\n",
    "You can iterate over a list with the for loop shown here:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "numbers = [99, 100, 101, 102]\n",
    "for n in numbers:\n",
    "    print(n)\n",
    "```\n",
    "    \n",
    "This code will print this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "99\n",
    "100\n",
    "101\n",
    "102\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indexing\n",
    "Another way to access the individual elements in a list is with an index. Each element in the list has an index that specifies its position in the list. Indexing starts at 0, so the index of the first element is 0, the second element is 1 and so forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "for example the following statement creates a list with 4 elements:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The indexes of the elements in the list are 0, 1, 2, and 3. We can print the elements of the list with the following statement:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(my_list[0], my_list[1], my_list[2], my_list[3])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The following loop also prints the elements of the list:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "index = 0\n",
    "while index < 4:\n",
    "    print(my_list[index])\n",
    "    index += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use negative index with lists to identify element position relative to the end of the list. The index -1 identifies the last in the list, -2 identifies next to the last element, and so forth. The following shows an example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40]\n",
    "print(my_list[-1], my_list[-2], my_list[-3], my_list[-4])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the print function will display:\n",
    "```\n",
    "40 30 20 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "An IndexError exception will be raised if you use an invalid index in a list, for example look at the following: "

    "### The len Function\n",
    "Python has built-in function named len that returns the length of a sequence. The following code demonstrates:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40]\n",
    "size = len(my_list)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The function returns the value 4, which is the number of elements in the list. This value is assigned to the size variable. The len function can be used to prevent an IndexError exception when iterating over a list with a loop. Here's an example: \n",
    "```\n",
    "my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40]\n",
    "index = 0\n",
    "while index < len(my_list):\n",

    "### Concatenating Lists\n",
    "To Concatenate means to join two things together. You can use the + operator to concatenate two lists. here's an example:\n",

    "list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "list2 = [5, 6, 7, 8]\n",
    "list3 = list1 + list2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After the code executes, list1 and list2 remain unchanged and list3 represents the following list:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use the += augmented operator to concatenate one list to another. Here's an example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "list2 = [5, 6, 7, 8]\n",
    "list1 += list2\n",

    "### List Slicing 7.3\n",
    "**Concept**: A slicing expression selects a range of elements from a sequence.\n",
    "Sometimes you want to select more than one element from a sequence. In Python, you can write expressions that select subsections of a sequence, know as slices.\n",
    "\n",
    "A slice is a span of items that are taken from a sequence. When you take a slice from a list, you get a span of elements from within the list.  To get a slice of a list, you write an expression in the following general format:\n",
    "```\n",
    "list[start : end]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Start is the index of the first element in the slice, and end is the index marking the end of the slice. The expression returns a list containing the copy of the elements from start up to end. For example suppose we create the following list:\n",
    "```\n",
    "days = ['Sunday', 'Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday', 'Friday', 'Saturday']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The following statement uses a slicing expression to get the elements up to indexes 2 up to, not including, 5:\n",
    "```\n",
    "mid_days = days[2:5]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After this statement executes, the mid_days variable references the following list:\n",
    "```\n",
    "['Tuesday', 'Wednesday', 'Thursday']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    " If you leave out the start index in a slicing expressions, Python uses 0 as the starting index. The following interactive mode session shows an example:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    ">>> print(numbers)\n",
    "[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    ">>> print(numbers[:3])\n",
    "[1, 2, 3]\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you leave out the end index in a slicing expressions, Python uses the length of the list as the end index. The following interactive mode session shows an example:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    ">>> print(numbers)\n",
    "[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    ">>> print(numbers[2:])\n",
    "[3, 4, 5]\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you leave out both the start and end in a slicing expressions, you get a copy of the entire list. The following interactive mode session shows an example:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    ">>> print(numbers)\n",
    "[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    ">>> print(numbers[:])\n",
    "[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Slicing expressions can also have a step value, which can cause elements to be skipped in the list. The following interactive mode session shows an example of a slicing expression with a step value:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n",
    ">>> print(numbers)\n",
    "[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n",

    "[2, 4, 6, 8]\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use negative numbers as indexes in slicing expressions to references positions relative to the end of the list. Python adds a negative to length of a list to get the position referenced by that index. The following interactive mode session shows an example:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n",
