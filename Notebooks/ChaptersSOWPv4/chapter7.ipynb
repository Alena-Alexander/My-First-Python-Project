    "# Lists and Tuples\n",
    "### Sequences 7.1\n",
    "**Concept**: A sequence is an object that holds multiple items of data, stored one after the other. You can perform operations on sequence to examine and manipulate the items stored in them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction to Lists 7.2\n",
    "**Concept**: A lists is an object that contains multiple data types. Lists are mutable which means there types can be changed during a program's execution. Lists are dynamic structures, meaning that items can be added to them or removed from them. You can use indexing slicing and various other methods to work with lists in a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each item that is stored in a list is called an element. Here's a statement that creates a list of integer:\n",
    "```\n",
    "even_numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]\n",
    "```\n",
    "The items that are enclosed in brackets and separated by commas are the lists elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is another example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "names = ['Molly', 'Steven', 'Will', 'Alicia', 'Adriana']\n",
    "```\n",
    "This statement creates a lists of five strings.\n",
    "\n",
    "A list can hold items of different types, as shown in the following example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "info = ['Alicia', 27, 1550.87]\n",
    "```\n",
    "This statement creates a list containing a string, an integer, and a floating-point number.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can print a use the print function to display an entire list, as shown here:\n",
    "```\n",
    "numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20]\n",
    "print(numbers)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The print function will display them like this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "[5, 10, 15, 20]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has built-in list() function that can convert certain objects to lists. You can use a statement such as that following to convert the range function's iterable object to a list:\n",
    "```\n",
    "numbers = list(range(5))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is another example: \n",
    "```\n",
    "numbers = list(range(1, 10, 2))\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This statement will assign [1, 3, 5, 7, 9] to the number variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Repetition Operator\n",
    "When an operand on the left side of the * symbol is a sequence and the operand on the left side is a integer, it becomes a repetition operator. The repetition operator makes multiple copies of a list and joins them all together. Here's the general format:\n",
    "```\n",
    "list * n\n",
    "```\n",
    "list is the list and n is the number of copies to make the following interactive session demonstrates:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> number = [0] * 5\n",
    ">>> print(number)\n",
    "[0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n",
    ">>> \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's another demonstration:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> numbers = [1, 2, 3] * 3\n",
    ">>> print(numbers)\n",
    "[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3]\n",
    ">>> \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Iterating over a List with the for Loop\n",
    "You can iterate over a list with the for loop shown here:\n",
    "```\n",
    "numbers = [99, 100, 101, 102]\n",
    "for n in numbers:\n",
    "    print(n)\n",
    "```\n",
    "    \n",
    "This code will print this:\n",
    "```\n",
    "99\n",
    "100\n",
    "101\n",
    "102\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indexing\n",
    "Another way to access the individual elements in a list is with an index. Each element in the list has an index that specifies its position in the list. Indexing starts at 0, so the index of the first element is 0, the second element is 1 and so forth.\n",
    "\n",
    "for example the following statement creates a list with 4 elements:\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The indexes of the elements in the list are 0, 1, 2, and 3. We can print the elements of the list with the following statement:\n",
    "```\n",
    "print(my_list[0], my_list[1], my_list[2], my_list[3])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The following loop also prints the elements of the list:\n",
    "```\n",
    "index = 0\n",
    "while index < 4:\n",
    "    print(my_list[index])\n",
    "    index += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use negative index with lists to identify element position relative to the end of the list. The index -1 identifies the last in the list, -2 identifies next to the last element, and so forth. The following shows an example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40]\n",
    "print(my_list[-1], my_list[-2], my_list[-3], my_list[-4])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the print function will display:\n",
    "```\n",
    "40 30 20 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n"
