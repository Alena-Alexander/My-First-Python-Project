    "As you can see, this code is one long sequence structure containing a lot of duplicates code. there are several disadvantages to this appproach, including the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The duplicated code makes the program larger.\n",
    "- Writing a long sequence of statements can be time-consuming.\n",
    "- if part of the duplicated code has to be corrected or changed, then the correction or change has to be done multiple times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of writing the same sequence multiple times, a better way to repeatedly perform an operation is to write the code for the operation once, the place the code in a structure that makes the computer repeat it as many times as necessary.\n",

    "### Condition-controlled and Count-controlled Loops\n",
    "A `condition-controlled loop` uses a true/false condition to control the number of times it repeats. A `count-controlled loop` repeats a specific number fo times. You use the `while` statement to write a `condition-controlled`, and you will use the `for` statement to write  a `count-controlled loop`.\n",

    "### The while Loop: A condition-controlled Loop 4.2\n",
    "**Concept**: A condition-controlled causes a statement or a set of statements to repeat as long as a condition is true. In Python, you use the while statement to write a condition controlled loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "The while loop gets its name from the way it works: while a condition is true, do some task. The loop has two parts: (1) A condition that is tested for a true or false value, and (2)  a statement or set of statements that repeats as long as the condition is true.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the general format of the while loop in Python:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "while condition:\n",
    "    statement\n",
    "    statement\n",
    "    # etc...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, we will refer to the first line as the while clause. The while clause begins with the word while, followed by a Boolean condition that will be evaluated as either true or false. A colon appears after the condition. Beginning at the next line is a block of statements. When the while loop executes, the condition is tested. if the condition is true, the statements that appear in the block following the while clause are executed, and the loop starts over. If the condition is false, the program exits the loop.\n",

    "### The while Loop is a Pretest Loop\n",
    "the while loop is know as a pretest loop, which means it tests its condition before, reforming a condition. because of this you usually have to perform some steps prior to the loop to make sure that the loop executes at least once. For example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "while keep == 'y':\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The loop will perform an iteration only if the expression keep_going == 'y' is true. this means that (a) the keep_going variable has to exist, and (b) it has to reference has to reference the value 'y'\n",

    "### Infinite Loops\n",
    "Loops must contain a way to terminate, if the loop does not have a way of stopping, it is called an infinite loop. An infinite loop continue to repeat until the program is interrupted.\n",

    "### The for Loop: A Count-Controlled Loop 4.3\n",
    "**Concept**: A count controlled loop iterates a specific number of times. In python you use the for statement to write a count-controlled loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "In python, the for statement  is designed to work with a sequence of data items. When the statement executes, it tierates once for each item in the sequence. Here is the general format:\n",

    "for variable in [value1, value2, etc..]:\n",
    "    statement\n",
    "    statement\n",
    "    # etc..\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We will refer to the first line as the for clause. In the for clause ,  variable is the name of a variable. Inside the brackets  a sequence of values appears, with a comma separating each value. Beginning at the next is a block of statements that is executed each time a loop iterates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The for statement executes in the following manner: The variable is assigned the first value in the list, then the statements that appear in block are executed. The variable is assigned the next value of the list, snd statements in blocks are executed again. This continues until variable has been assigned the last value in the list.\n"
