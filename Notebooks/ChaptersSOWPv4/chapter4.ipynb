    "### Sentinels 4.5\n",
    "**Concept**:A sentinel is a special value that marks the end of a sequence of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following the scenario: you are designing a program that will use a loop to process a long sequence of values.\\\n",
    "At the time you are designing the program, you do not know the number of value that will be in the sequence.\\\n",
    "In fact, the number of values in the sequence could be different each time the program is executed. What is the best\\\n",
    "way to design such a loop? Here are some techniques that you have seen already in this chapter, along with the disadvantages\\\n",
    "of using them when processing a long list of values:                      \n",
    "                                       \n",
    "- Simply ask the user, at the end of each loop iteration, if there is another value to process. If the sequence of values is long,\\\n",
    "however, asking this question at the end of each loop iteration might make the program cumbersome for the user.\n",
    "- Ask the user at the beginning of the program how many items are in the sequence. This might also inconvenience the user, however.\\\n",
    "If the sequence is very long, and the user does not know the number of items it contains, it will require the user to count them.\n",
    "\n",
    "When processing a long sequence of values with a loop, perhaps a better technique is to use a sentinel. A sentinel is a\\\n",
    "special value that marks the end of a sequence of items. When a program reads the sentinel value, it knows it has reached\\\n",
    "the end of the sequence, so the loop terminates.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose a doctor wants a program to calculate the average weight of all her patients. The program might work\\\n",
    "like this: A loop prompts the user to enter either a patients weight, or 0 if there are no more weights.\\\n",
    "When the program reads 0 as a weight, it interprets that as a signal that there are no more weights.\\\n",
    "The loop ends and the program displays the average weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "A sentinel value must be distinctive enough that it will not be mistaken as a regular value in the sequence.\n"

    "### Input Validation Loops 4.6\n",
    "**Concept**: Input validation is the process of inspecting data that has been input to a program, to make sure\\\n",
    "it is valid before it is used in a computation. Input validation is commonly done with a loop that iterates as\\\n",
    "long as an input variable references bad data.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most famous sayings among computer programmers is \"Garbage in, garbage out.\" This saying, sometimes\\\n",
    "abbreviated as GIGO, refers to the fact that computers cannot tell the difference between good data and bad data.\\\n",
    "If a user provides bad data as input to a program, the program will process that bad data and, as a result,\\\n",
    "will produce bad data as an output.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes stories are reported in the news about computer errors that mistakenly cause people to be charged\\\n",
    "thousands of dollars for small purchases, or to receive large tax refunds to which they were not entitled.\\\n",
    "These \"computer errors\" are rarely caused by the computer however; they are more commonly caused by bad data\\\n",
    "that was read into a program as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the input is invalid, the program should discard it and prompt the user to enter the correct data.\\\n",
    "This process is known as input validation.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the input is bad, the loop executes its block of statements. The loop displays an error message so the user\\\n",
    "will know that the input was invalid, and then it reads the new input. The loop repeats as long as the input is bad. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Nested Loops 4.7\n",
    "**Concept**:A loop that is inside another loop is called a nested loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "A nested loop is a loop that is inside another loop. A clock is a good example of something that works like a nested loop.\\\n",
    "The second hand, minute hand, and the hour hand all spin around the face of the clock. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a loop that partially simulates a digital clock. it displays the seconds from 0 to 59:\n",
    "```\n",
    "for seconds in range(60):\n",
    "    print(seconds)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can add a minutes variable and the nest loop above inside another loop that cycles through 60 minutes:\n",
    "```\n",
    "for minutes in range(60):\n",
    "    for seconds in range(60):\n",
    "        print(minutes, ':', seconds)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To make the simulated clock complete, another varible and loop can be added to count the hours.\n",
    "```\n",
    "for hours in range(24):\n",
    "    for minutes in range(60):\n",
    "        for seconds in range(60):\n",
    "            print(hours, ':', minutes, ':', seconds)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The innermost loop will iterate 60 times for each iteration of the middle loop. The middle loop will iterate 60\\\n",
    "for each iteration of the outermost loop. When the outermost loop has iterated 24 times, the middle loop have iterated\\\n",
    "1,440 times and the innermost loop will have iterated 86,400 times!\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulated clock example brings up a few points about nested loops:\n",
    "- An inner loop goes through all its iterations for every single iteration of an outerloop.\n",
    "- Inner loops complete their iteration faster than outer loops.\n",
    "- To get the total number of iterations of a nested loop, multiply the of iterations of all the loops.\n"
