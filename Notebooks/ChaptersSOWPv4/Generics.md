# Using Generics in Python

Python, as a language, doesn't have built-in support for generics in the same 
way languages like Java or C# do. However, starting with Python 3.5, the `typing` 
module was introduced, which has some support for generic programming concepts 
through type hinting. The `typing` module can help enforce and understand how 
types are supposed to be used throughout your code, although it's not strictly 
enforced at runtime in the same manner as statically typed languages.

### Basics of Generics in Python

Generics allow you to write code that works with different data types while providing 
type safety. It's particularly useful in collection types and functions that operate 
on data where the type may vary.

#### Using `Generic` and `TypeVar`

1. **`TypeVar`**: This is used to define a placeholder for a type that will be specified 
later. It can be seen as a way to indicate that multiple uses of this type parameter 
in the input/output must all be the same concrete type.

2. **`Generic`**: This is used as a base class to specify that a class will use one or 
several `TypeVar` parameters.


Here's how you use them:

```python
from typing import TypeVar, Generic, List

# Define a type variable
T = TypeVar('T')

# Create a generic class using the type variable
class Box(Generic[T]):
    def __init__(self, content: T) -> None:
        self.content = content
    
    def get_content(self) -> T:
        return self.content
```

Here, `Box` is a generic class that can hold any type of item, as defined by `T`.

### Example 1: A Simple Generic Data Structure

Let's build a simple set of classes modeling a generic repository and a fitting service.

```python
from typing import TypeVar, Generic, List, Callable

# Define a type variable
T = TypeVar('T')

# Create a generic repository class
class Repository(Generic[T]):
    def __init__(self):
        self._items: List[T] = []
    
    def add(self, item: T) -> None:
        self._items.append(item)
    
    def get_all(self) -> List[T]:
        return self._items
    
    def find(self, condition: Callable) -> List[T]:
        return [item for item in self._items if condition(item)]

# Example entity classes
class User:
    def __init__(self, name: str, age: int):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def __str__(self):
        return f"User({self.name}, {self.age})"

class Product:
    def __init__(self, name: str, price: float):
        self.name = name
        self.price = price

    def __str__(self):
        return f"Product({self.name}, {self.price})"

# Usage
user_repo = Repository[User]()
user_repo.add(User("Alice", 30))
user_repo.add(User("Bob", 25))

product_repo = Repository[Product]()
product_repo.add(Product("Laptop", 999.99))
product_repo.add(Product("Phone", 499.99))

print("Users: ")
for user in user_repo.get_all():
    print(user)

# Find users older than 28
print("\nAdult Users: ")
for adult in user_repo.find(lambda u: u.age > 28):
    print(adult)

print("\nProducts: ")
for product in product_repo.get_all():
    print(product)
    
# Find products with a price greater than 500
print("\nExpensive Products: ")
for prod in product_repo.find(lambda p: p.price > 500):
    print(prod)
    
```

### Example 2: A Generic Service Layer

In this example, we'll have a service for handling both `User` and `Product`. We'll 
utilize generics for code reuse while ensuring type safety.

```python
from typing import TypeVar, Generic, List, Callable

# Define a type variable
T = TypeVar('T')

# Create a generic service class
class Service(Generic[T]):
    def __init__(self, repository: Repository[T]):
        self.repository = repository
    
    def add_item(self, item: T) -> None:
        self.repository.add(item)
    
    def find_items(self, condition: Callable) -> List[T]:
        return self.repository.find(condition)

# Using the previously defined Repository and classes 
user_service = Service(user_repo)
product_service = Service(product_repo)

# Adding more users and products using services
user_service.add_item(User("Charlie", 28))
product_service.add_item(Product("Tablet", 299.99))

# Finding users and products
adults = user_service.find_items(lambda u: u.age >= 30)
expensive_products = product_service.find_items(lambda p: p.price > 500)

print("\nAdults: ")
for adult in adults:
    print(adult)

print("\nExpensive Products: ")
for prod in expensive_products:
    print(prod)
```

### Class Diagram

Here's a class diagram showing the relationships between the classes in the examples:

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Repository~T~ {
        -List~T~ _items
        +add(item: T): void
        +get_all(): List~T~
        +find(condition): List~T~
    }

    class Service~T~ {
        -Repository~T~ repository
        +add_item(item: T): void
        +find_items(condition): List~T~
    }

    class User {
        -str name
        -int age
        +__str__(): str
    }

    class Product {
        -str name
        -float price
        +__str__(): str
    }

    Repository~T~ <|-- User
    Repository~T~ <|-- Product
    Service~T~ *-- Repository~T~
    Service~T~ <|-- User
    Service~T~ <|-- Product
```



### Benefits of Generics in Python

1. **Code Reusability**: Generics allow you to write code that can work with different 
types without repeating the same logic for each type.
2. **Type Safety**: While Python is dynamically typed, using generics with type hints
can help catch type-related errors early in development.
3. **Maintainability**: By using generics, you can create more flexible and maintainable 
code that can adapt to changes in requirements or data structures.
4. **Readability**: Generics can make your code more re### Benefits of Generics in Python
