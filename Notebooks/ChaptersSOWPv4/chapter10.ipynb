    "# Classes and Object-Oriented Programming\n",
    "### Procedural and Object-Oriented Programming 10.1\n",
    "**Concept**: Procedural Programming is a method of writing software. It is a programming practice centered on the procedures or actions that take places in a program. Object-Oriented Programming is centered on objects. Object are created from abstract data types that encapsulates data and functions together.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are primarily two methods of programming in use today: procedural and object-oriented. The earliest programming languages were procedural, meaning a program made of one or more procedures. You can think of a procedure simply as a function that performs a specific task such as gathering input from the use, performing calculations, reading or writing files, displaying output, and so on. The programs that you've written have been procedural. \n",
    "\n",
    "Procedures operate on data items that are separate from procedures. The focus of procedural programming is on the creation of procedures that operate on the programs' data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Procedural programming is centered on procedures(functions), Object-Oriented Programming(OOP) is centered on objects. An object is a software that contains both data and procedures. The data contained in an object is known as its data attributes. An objects data attributes are simply variables that reference data. The procedures that an object performs are known as methods. An objects methods are function that perform operations on data attributes. The object is a self-contained unit that consist of data attributes and methods that operate on them.\n",
    "\n",
    "OOP addresses the problem of code and data separation through encapsulation and data hiding. Encapsulation refers to the combining of data and code into a single object. Data hiding refers to the objects ability to hide its data from code that is outside the object. Only the objects methods may directly access and make changes to the objects data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Object Reusability\n",
    "The use of OOP has also been encouraged by the trend of Object Reusability. An object is not a stand-alone program, but is used by programs that need its services. For example, Sarah is a programmer who had developed a set of objects for rendering 3D images. Tom, who is writing a program for an architectural firm, can use Sharon's objects to perform the 3D rendering.\n",
    "\n",
    "### An Everyday Example of an Object\n",
    "Imagine that you alarm clock is actually a software object. If it were, it would have the following data attributes:\n",
    "- current_second(a value in the range of 0-59)\n",
    "- current_minute(a value in the range of 0-59)\n",
    "- current_hour(a value in the range of 1-12)\n",
    "- alarm_time(a valid hour and minute)\n",
    "- alarm_is_set(True or False)\n",
    "\n",
    "You, the user of the alarm clock object, cannot directly manipulate these attributes because they're private. To change a data attribute value, you must use one of the objects' method. The following are some of the alarm clock objects methods:\n",
    "- set_time\n",
    "- set_alarm_time\n",
    "- set_alarm_on\n",
    "- set_alarm_off\n",
    "\n",
    "Methods that can be accessed by entities outside the object are known as public methods(set_alarm_on, set_alarm_off, set_time, and set_alarm_time). The alarm clock object also has private methods, which are part of the objects private, internal workings. The following are the alarm clock object's private methods:\n",
    "- increment_current_second\n",
    "- increment_current_minute\n",
    "- increment_current_hour\n",
    "- sound_alarm\n",
    "\n",
    "### Classes 10.2\n",
    "**Concept**: A class is code that specifies the data attributes and methods for a particular type of object.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before an object can be created, it must be designed by a program to determine what data attributes and method are necessary, then a class is created. You can think of a class as a blueprint.\n",
    "\n",
    " A class is description of an objects characteristics. Each object that is created from a class is called an instance of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Class Definitions\n",
    "To create a class, you write a class definition. A class definition is a set of statements that defines a class's methods and data attributes. \n",
    "Here's an example of a class:"

    "The same rule that apply to variable names also apply to class names. However, notice how we started the class name, Coin, with an uppercase letter. This is not required, but it is a widely used convention among programmers. The Coin class has three methods:\n",
    "- The __init__ method \n",
    "- The Toss method\n",
    "- The get_sideup method\n",
    "Notice that these methods look like any other function definition in Python. And notice that each method has a parameter variable named self:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Line 11: def __init__(self):\n",
    "Line 19: def toss(self):\n",
    "Line 28: def get_sideup(self):\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The self parameter is required in every method of a class. When a method executes, it must have a way of knowing which object's data attributes it is supposed to operate on. That's when the self parameter comes in. When a method is called, Python makes the self parameter reference the specific object the method is supposed to operate on. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most Python classes have a method named __init__ which is automatically created when an instance of a class is created in memory. The __init__ method is commonly known as the initializer method because it initializes the objects data attributes. Immediately, after an object is created in memory, the __init__ executes, and the self parameter is automatically assigned the object that was created. As result each object that we create from the Coin class will initially have a side up attribute that is set too heads."
