    "### The if Statement 3.1\n",
    "\n",
    "**concept**: The `if statement` is used to create a `decision structure`, which allows a `program` to have more than one path of execution.\\\n",
    "The `if statement` causes one or more statements to execute only when a `boolean` expression is `true`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `control structure` is a logical design that controls the order in which a set of statements execute.\\\n",
    "We have used only the simplest type of `control structure`: the `sequence structure`.\\\n",
    "A `sequence structure` is a set of statements that execute in the order in which they appear.\\\n",
    "For example, the following code is a sequence: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "name = input('What is your name?')\n",
    "age = int(input('What is your age?'))\n",
    "print('Here is the data you entered:')\n",
    "print('Name:', name)\n",
    "print('Age:', age)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Some programs simply cannot be solved by performing as set of ordered steps,\\\n",
    "these programs require a different type of `control structure`: One that can execute a set of statements\\\n",

    "\n",
    "Consider we are determining if Cold outside is true or false. If this condition is true, the action Wear a coat is performed.\\\n",
