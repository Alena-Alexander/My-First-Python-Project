    "### Decision Structures and Boolean Logic\n",
    "### The if Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "**concept**: The `if statement` is used to create a `decision structure`, which allows a `program` to have more than one path of execution.\\\n",
    "The `if statement` causes one or more statements to execute only when a `boolean` expression is `true`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `control structure` is a logical design that controls the order in which a set of statements execute.\\\n",
    "We have used only the simplest type of `control structure`: the `sequence structure`.\\\n",
    "A `sequence structure` is a set of statements that execute in the order in which they appear.\\\n",
    "For example, the following code is a sequence: \n",
    "```\n",
    "name = input('What is your name?')\n",
    "age = int(input('What is your age?'))\n",
    "print('Here is the data you entered:')\n",
    "print('Name:', name)\n",
    "print('Age:', age)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Some programs simply cannot be solved by performing as set of ordered steps,\\\n",
    "these programs require a different type of `control structure`: One that can execute a set of statements\\\n",
    "only under certain circumstances. This can be accomplished with a `decision structure`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider we are determining if Cold outside is true or false. If this condition is true, the action Wear a coat is performed.\\\n",
    "If the condition is false the action is skipped. The action is conditionally executed because it is performed only when a\\\n",
    "certain condition is true. Programmers call the type of decision structure with only one condition a single alternative decision structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, we use the if statement to write a single alternative decision structure.\\\n",
    "Here is the general format of the if statement:\n",
    "```\n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "    statement\n",
    "    statement\n",
    "    etc.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "For simplicity, we will refer to the first line as the if-clause. The if-clause begins with the word if, followed by a condition,\\\n",
    "which is an expression that will be evaluated as either true or false. A colon appears after the condition.\\\n",
    "Beginning at the next line is a block of statements. A block is simply a set statements that belong together as a group.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Boolean Expressions and Rational Operators\n",
    "The expressions that are tested by the if statement are called Boolean expressions, named in honor of the English mathematician George Boole.\\\n",
    "The Boolean expression that is tested by an if statement is formed with a relational operator.\\\n",
    "A rational operator determines whether a specific relationship exists between two value.\\\n",
    "For example, the greater than operator (>) determines whether one value is greater than another.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Operator |         Meaning          |\n",
    "|:--------:|:------------------------:|\n",
    "|    >     |       Greater than       |\n",
    "|    <     |        Less than         |\n",
    "|    >=    | Greater than or equal to |\n",
    "|    <=    |  Less than or equal to   |\n",
    "|    ==    |         Equal to         |\n",
    "|    !=    |       Not equal to       |\n",
    "\n",
    "The following is an example of an expression that uses the greater than (>) operator to compare two variables:\n",
    "```\n",

    "### The >= and <= Operators\n",
    "Two of the operators, >= and <=, test for more than one relationship. The >= operator determines whether the operand on\\\n",
    "its left is greater than or equal to the operand on its right. The <= operator determines whether the operand on its left\\\n",

    "### Putting it all together\n",
    "Let's look at the following example of the if statement:\n",
    "```\n",
