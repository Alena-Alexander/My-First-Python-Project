    "# Dictionaries and Sets\n",
    "### Dictionaries 9.1\n",
    "**Concept**: A dictionary is an object that stores a collection of data. Each element in a dictionary has 2 parts: A key and a Value. You use a key to locate a specific value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionary elements are commonly referred to as key-value pairs. When you want to receive a specific value from a dictionary, you use the key that is associated with that value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a Dictionary\n",
    "You ca create a dictionary by enclosing the elements in a set of curly braces( {} ). An element consist of a key, followed by a colon, followed by a value. The elements are separated by commas. The following statement shows an example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "phonebook = {'Chris':'555-1111', 'Katie':'555-2222', 'Joanna':'555-3333'}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Retrieving a Value from a Dictionary\n",
    "The elements in a dictionary are not stored in any particular order. For example look at the following interactive session in which a dictionary is created and the elements are displayed:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> phonebook = {'Chris':'555-1111', 'Katie':'555-2222', \n",
    "'Joanna':'555-3333'}\n",
    ">>> phonebook\n",
    "{'Chris':'555-1111', 'Katie':'555-2222', 'Joanna':'555-3333'}\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice the order in which the elements are displayed is different from the order in which they were created. This demonstrates how dictionaries are not sequences, like list, tuple, and strings. As a result you cannot use a numeric index to retrieve a value by its position from a dictionary. Instead, you use a key to receive a value\n",
    "\n",
    "To receive a value from a dictionary, you simply write an expression in the following general format: \n",
    "```\n",
    "dictionary_name[key]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using the in and not in Operators for a Value in a Dictionary\n",
    "You can use the in operator to determine whether a key exist before you try to use it to retrieve a value.\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> phonebook = {'Chris':'555-1111', 'Katie':'555-2222', \n",
    "'Joanna':'555-3333'}\n",
    ">>> if 'Chris' in phonebook:\n",
    "    print(phonebook['Chris'])\n",
    "\n",
    "555-1111\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the not in operator to determine whether a key does not exist, as demonstrated in the following session:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> phonebook = {'Chris':'555-1111', 'Katie':'555-2222', \n",
    "'Joanna':'555-3333'}\n",
    ">>> if 'Joanna' not in phonebook:\n",
    "    print('Joanna is not found.')\n",
    "\n",
    "Joanna is not found.\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding Elements to an Existing Dictionary\n",
    "Dictionaries a mutable objects. You can add new key-value pairs to a dictionary with an assignment statement in the following general format:\n",
    "```\n",
    "dictionary_name[key] = value\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If key already exist in the dictionary, its associated value will be changed to value. If key does not exist, it will be added to the dictionary, along with the value as its associated value. The following interactive session demonstrates this:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> phonebook = {'Chris':'555-1111', 'Katie':'555-2222', \n",
    "'Joanna':'555-3333'}\n",
    ">>> phonebook['Joe'] =  '555-0123'\n",
    ">>> phonebook['Chris'] = '555-4444'\n",
    ">>> phonebook\n",
    "{'Chris':'555-4444', 'Joanna':'555-3333', 'Joe':'555-0123', 'Katie':'555-2222'}\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deleting Elements\n",
    "You can delete an existing key-value pair from a dictionary with a del statement. Here is the general format:\n",
    "```\n",
    "del dictionary_name[key]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The following interactive session demonstrates:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> phonebook = {'Chris':'555-1111', 'Katie':'555-2222', \n",
    "'Joanna':'555-3333'}\n",
    ">>> phonebook\n",
    "{'Chris':'555-1111', 'Joanna':'555-3333', 'Katie':'555-2222'}\n",
    ">>> del phonebook['Chris']\n",
    ">>> phonebook\n",
    "{'Joanna':'555-3333', 'Katie':'555-2222'}\n",
    ">>> del phonebook['Chris']\n",
    "Traceback (Most recent call last):\n",
    "    file \"<pyshell#5>\", line 1, in <module>\n",
    "        del phonebook['Chris']\n",
    "Keyerror: 'Chris'\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting the Number of Elements in a Dictionary\n",
    "You can use the built-in len function to get the number of elements in a dictionary. The following interactive session demonstrates:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> phonebook = {'Chris':'555-1111', 'Katie':'555-2222'}\n",
    ">>> num_items = len(phonebook)\n",
    ">>> print(num_items)\n",
    "2\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mixing Data Types in a Dictionary\n",
    "The keys in a dictionary must be immutable objects, but their associated values can be any type of object. For example the values can be list, as demonstrated in the following interactive session. In this session, in which the keys are student names, and the values are a lists of test scores:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> test_scores = {'Kayla':[88, 92, 100], \n",
    "                  'Luis':[94, 74, 81], \n",
    "                  'Sophie':[72, 88, 91], \n",
    "                  'Ethan':[70, 75, 78], }\n",
    ">>> test_scores\n",
    "{'Kayla':[88, 92, 100], 'Luis':[94, 74, 81], 'Sophie':[72, 88, 91], 'Ethan':[70, 75, 78], }\n",
    ">>> test_scores['Sophie']\n",
    "[72, 88, 91]\n",
    ">>> Kayla_scores = test_scores[Kayla]\n",
    ">>> print(Kayla_scores)\n",
    "[88, 92, 100]\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating an Empty Dictionary\n",
    "Sometimes, you need to create an empty dictionary and add elements to it as the program executes. You can use an empty set of curly braces to create an empty dictionary, as demonstrated in the following interactive session:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> phonebook = {}\n",
    ">>> phonebook['Chris'] = '555-1111'\n",
    ">>> phonebook['Katie'] = '555-2222'\n",

    "### Using the For Loop to Iterate over a Dictionary\n",
    "You can use the for loop in the following general format to iterate over all the keys in a dictionary:\n",
    "```\n",
    "for var in dictionary:\n",
    "    statement\n",
    "    statement\n",
    "    etc.\n",

    "### Sets 9.2\n",
    "**Concept**: A set contains a collection of unique values and works like a mathematical set.\n",
    "A set is an object that stores a collection of data in the same way as mathematical sets. Here are some important things to know about sets:\n",
    "- All elements in a set must be unique. No elements can have the same value. \n",
    "- Sets are unordered, which means that the elements in a set are not stored in any particular ordered.\n",
    "- The elements that are in a set can be of different data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a Set\n",
    "To a create a set, you have to call the built-in set function. Here's an example of how you create an empty set:\n",
    "```\n",
    "myset = set()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The argument that you pass be an object that contains iterable elements, such as a list, a tuple, or a string. The individual elements of the object that you pass becomes elements of the set. Here is an example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "myset = set(['a', 'b', 'c'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you pass a string as an argument to the set function, each individual character of the string becomes a member of the set. Here is an example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "myset = set('abc')\n",
    "```\n",
    "After this statement, the myset variable will reference a set containing the elements 'a', 'b', and 'c'.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sets cannot have duplicate elements, if you pass an argument containing a duplicate to the set function, only one of the duplicated elements will appear in the set. Here's an example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "myset = set('aaabc')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The a appears multiple times in the string it will only appear once in the set.\n",
    "\n",
    "How would you create a set containing elements 'one', 'two', and 'three'? The following code doesnt accomplish the task, because you can pass no more than one argument to the set function. To create the set that we want, we have to pass a list containing the strings 'one', 'two', and 'three' as an argument to the set function. Here's an example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "# Ok this works\n",
    "myset = set(['one', 'two', 'three'])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting the Number of Elements in a Set\n",
    "You can use te len function to get the number of elements in a set. The following interactive session demonstrates:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> myset = set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n",
    ">>> len(myset)\n",
    "5\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding and Removing Elements\n",
    "You can use the add method to add an element to the set. The following interactive session demonstrates:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> myset = set()\n",
    ">>> myset.add(1)\n",

    ">>> myset\n",
    "[1, 2, 3]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can add a group of elements to a set all at one time with the update method. When you call the update method as an argument, you pass an  object that contains iterable elements, such as a list, a tuple, string, or another set. The individual elements of the object that you pass as an argument become elements of a set. The following interactive session demonstrates:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> myset = set([1, 2, 3])\n",
    ">>> myset.update([4, 5, 6])\n",
    ">>> myset\n",
    "{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}\n",

    "```\n",
    ">>> set1 = set([1, 2, 3])\n",
    ">>> set2 = set([8, 9, 10])\n",
    ">>> set1.update(set2)\n",

    "You can remove an item from the set with either the remove method or the discard method. The remove method raises a KeyError exception, but the discard method does not raise an exception. The following interactive session demonstrates:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> myset = set([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])\n",
    ">>> myset\n",
