    "# Dictionaries and Sets\n",
    "### Dictionaries 9.1\n",
    "**Concept**: A dictionary is an object that stores a collection of data. Each element in a dictionary has 2 parts: A key and a Value. You use a key to locate a specific value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Dictionary elements are commonly referred to as key-value pairs. When you want to receive a specific value from a dictionary, you use the key that is associated with that value.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a Dictionary\n",
    "You ca create a dictionary by enclosing the elements in a set of curly braces( {} ). An element consist of a key, followed by a colon, followed by a value. The elements are separated by commas. The following statement shows an example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "phonebook = {'Chris':'555-1111', 'Katie':'555-2222', 'Joanna':'555-3333'}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Retrieving a Value from a Dictionary\n",
    "The elements in a dictionary are not stored in any particular order. For example look at the following interactive session in which a dictionary is created and the elements are displayed:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> phonebook = {'Chris':'555-1111', 'Katie':'555-2222', \n",
    "'Joanna':'555-3333'}\n",
    ">>> phonebook\n",
    "{'Chris':'555-1111', 'Katie':'555-2222', 'Joanna':'555-3333'}\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice the order in which the elements are displayed is different from the order in which they were created. This demonstrates how dictionaries are not sequences, like list, tuple, and strings. As a result you cannot use a numeric index to retrieve a value by its position from a dictionary. Instead, you use a key to receive a value\n",
    "\n",
    "To receive a value from a dictionary, you simply write an expression in the following general format: \n",
    "```\n",
    "dictionary_name[key]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using the in and not in Operators for a Value in a Dictionary\n",
    "You can use the in operator to determine whether a key exist before you try to use it to retrieve a value.\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> phonebook = {'Chris':'555-1111', 'Katie':'555-2222', \n",
    "'Joanna':'555-3333'}\n",
    ">>> if 'Chris' in phonebook:\n",
    "    print(phonebook['Chris'])\n",
    "\n",
    "555-1111\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the not in operator to determine whether a key does not exist, as demonstrated in the following session:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> phonebook = {'Chris':'555-1111', 'Katie':'555-2222', \n",
    "'Joanna':'555-3333'}\n",
    ">>> if 'Joanna' not in phonebook:\n",
    "    print('Joanna is not found.')\n",
    "\n",
    "Joanna is not found.\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding Elements to an Existing Dictionary\n",
    "Dictionaries a mutable objects. You can add new key-value pairs to a dictionary with an assignment statement in the following general format:\n",
    "```\n",
    "dictionary_name[key] = value\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If key already exist in the dictionary, its associated value will be changed to value. If key does not exist, it will be added to the dictionary, along with the value as its associated value. The following interactive session demonstrates this:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> phonebook = {'Chris':'555-1111', 'Katie':'555-2222', \n",
    "'Joanna':'555-3333'}\n",
    ">>> phonebook['Joe'] =  '555-0123'\n",
    ">>> phonebook['Chris'] = '555-4444'\n",
    ">>> phonebook\n",
    "{'Chris':'555-4444', 'Joanna':'555-3333', 'Joe':'555-0123', 'Katie':'555-2222'}\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deleting Elements\n",
    "You can delete an existing key-value pair from a dictionary with a del statement. Here is the general format:\n",
    "```\n",
    "del dictionary_name[key]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The following interactive session demonstrates:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> phonebook = {'Chris':'555-1111', 'Katie':'555-2222', \n",
    "'Joanna':'555-3333'}\n",
    ">>> phonebook\n",
    "{'Chris':'555-1111', 'Joanna':'555-3333', 'Katie':'555-2222'}\n",
    ">>> del phonebook['Chris']\n",
    ">>> phonebook\n",
    "{'Joanna':'555-3333', 'Katie':'555-2222'}\n",
    ">>> del phonebook['Chris']\n",
    "Traceback (Most recent call last):\n",
    "    file \"<pyshell#5>\", line 1, in <module>\n",
    "        del phonebook['Chris']\n",
    "Keyerror: 'Chris'\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting the Number of Elements in a Dictionary\n",
    "You can use the built-in len function to get the number of elements in a dictionary. The following interactive session demonstrates:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> phonebook = {'Chris':'555-1111', 'Katie':'555-2222'}\n",
    ">>> num_items = len(phonebook)\n",
    ">>> print(num_items)\n",
    "2\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mixing Data Types in a Dictionary\n",
    "The keys in a dictionary must be immutable objects, but their associated values can be any type of object. For example the values can be list, as demonstrated in the following interactive session. In this session, in which the keys are student names, and the values are a lists of test scores:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> test_scores = {'Kayla':[88, 92, 100], \n",
    "                  'Luis':[94, 74, 81], \n",
    "                  'Sophie':[72, 88, 91], \n",
    "                  'Ethan':[70, 75, 78], }\n",
    ">>> test_scores\n",
    "{'Kayla':[88, 92, 100], 'Luis':[94, 74, 81], 'Sophie':[72, 88, 91], 'Ethan':[70, 75, 78], }\n",
    ">>> test_scores['Sophie']\n",
    "[72, 88, 91]\n",
    ">>> Kayla_scores = test_scores[Kayla]\n",
    ">>> print(Kayla_scores)\n",
    "[88, 92, 100]\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating an Empty Dictionary\n",
    "Sometimes, you need to create an empty dictionary and add elements to it as the program executes. You can use an empty set of curly braces to create an empty dictionary, as demonstrated in the following interactive session:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> phonebook = {}\n",
    ">>> phonebook['Chris'] = '555-1111'\n",
    ">>> phonebook['Katie'] = '555-2222'\n",
    ">>> phonebook['Joanna'] = '555-3333'\n",
    ">>> phonebook\n",
    "{'Chris':'555-1111', 'Joanna':'555-3333', 'Katie':'555-2222'}\n",
    ">>>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using the For Loop to Iterate over a Dictionary\n",
    "You can use the for loop in the following general format to iterate over all the keys in a dictionary:\n",
    "```\n",
    "for var in dictionary:\n",
    "    statement\n",
    "    statement\n",
    "    etc.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each time the loop iterates, the var is assigned a key. The following interactive session demonstrates:\n",
    "```\n",
    ">>> phonebook = {'Chris':'555-1111', \n",
    "                 'Katie':'555-3333', \n",
    "                 'Joanna':'555-3333'}\n",
