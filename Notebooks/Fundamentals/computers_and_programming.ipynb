    "# Introduction to Computers and programming\n",
    "### Introduction 1.1\n",
    "`Computers` perform such a wide variety of tasks because they can be `programmed` to.  \n",
    "This means that`computers` are not designed to do just one job, but to do any job that their `program` tells them to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `program` is a set of instructions that a computer follows to perform task `Microsoft Word` and `PowerPoint` are `2` commonly used `programs`.\\\n",
    "`programs` are commonly referred to as `software`. All the `software` that we use to make our `computers` useful  \n",
    "are created by individuals working as`programmers` or `software developers`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `programmer` or `software developer`, is a person with the training and skills necessary to design, create, and test computer programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hardware and Software 1.2\n",
    "The `physical devices` of which a `computer` is made are referred to as the `computers' hardware`. The programs that run on the `computer` are\\\n",
    "referred to as `software`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The term `hardware` refers to all the `physical devices`, or  `components`, of which a `computer` is made. A `computer` is not a `single device` but a `system of devices` that all work together.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical `computer system` consists of the following major `components`:\n",
    "- A central processing unit(CPU)\n",
    "- Main memory\n",
    "- secondary storage devices\n",
    "- output devices\n",
    "- input devices\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The CPU\n",
    "When a `computer` is performing the tasks that a `program` tells it to do,\\\n",
    "we say that the `computer` is running or executing the `program`.\\\n",
    "The `central processing unit`, or `CPU`, is the part of the `computer` that actually runs the `programs`.\\\n",
    "The `CPU` is the most `important component` in a `computer`  because without it the `computer` would not run `software`.\\\n",
    "`CPUs` are all small chips known as `microprocessors`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main memory\n",
    "You can think of `main memory` as the `computers' work area`.\\\n",
    "This is where the `computer` stores a `program` while the `program` is `running`,\\\n",
    "as well as the `data` the `program` is working with.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Secondary Storage device \n",
    "`Secondary Storage` is a type of memory that can hold `data` for long periods of time,\\\n",
    "even when there is no power to the `computer`. `Programs` are normally stored in `secondary`\\\n",
    "`memory` and loaded into `main memory` as needed. Important `data`, such as w`ord processing documents`,\\\n",
    "`payroll data`, and `inventory records`, is saved in `secondary storage` as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common type of `secondary storage device` is the `disk drive`.\\\n",
    "A `traditional disk drive` stores `data` by magnetically encoding it onto a spinning circular disk.\n",
    " \n",
    "`External storage devices`, which connect to one of the `computers' communication ports`,\\\n",
    "are also available. `External storage devices` can be used to create backup copies of important\n",
    "data or to move data to another computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "`For example:`\n",
    "`USB drives` are small devices tha plug into the `computers' USB port` and appear to the system as a `disk drive`.\\\n",
    "These `drives` do not actually contain a `disk` , however, the store data in a special type of memory known as `flash memory`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input devices\n",
    "`Input` is any `data` the `computer` collects from people and from other `devices`.\\\n",
    "The `component` that collects `data` and sends it to the `computer` is called an `input device`.\\\n",
    "Common input devices are `keyboard`, `mouse`, `touchscreen`, `scanner`, `microphone`, and `digital cam`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output devices\n",
    "`Output` is any data the `computer` produces for people or for other `devices`.\\\n",
    "It might be a `sales report`, `a list of names`, or a `graphic image`.\\\n",
    "The `data` is sent to an `output device`, which `formats` and `presents` it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Software\n",
    "Everything a computer does from the time you turn the power switch on until you shut the `system` down,\\\n",
    "is under the control of `software`\n",
    "\n",
    "### System software\n",
    "The `programs` that control and manage the basic operations of a `computer` are referred to as `system software`.\\\n",
    "`system software` typically includes the following types of `programs`:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Operating Systems:`\n",
    "An `Operating System` is the most `fundamental` set of `programs` on a `computer`.\\\n",
    "The `operating system` controls the `internal operations` of the `computers hardware`,\\\n",
    "manages all the `devices` connected to the `computer`, allows `data` to be `saved` to and `retrieved`\\\n",
    "from `storage devices` and allows other `programs` to run on the `computer`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Utility Programs:`\n",
    "A `Utility Program` performs a specialized task that `enhances` the `computers' operation` or `safeguards data`.\\\n",
    "For example: `virus scanners`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Software Development Tools:`\n",
    "`Software Development Tools` are the `programs` that `programmers` use to `create`, `modify`, and `test` `software`.\n",
    "`Assemblers`, `Compilers`, and `interpreters` are good examples of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How computers store data 1.3\n",
    "A `computers memory` is divided into tiny storage locations known as `bytes`.\n",
    "One `byte` is enough memory to store a letter of the alphabet or a small number.\n",
    "In order to do anything meaningful, a `computer` has to have lots of `bytes`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each `byte` is divided into eight smaller `storage` known as `bits`.\n",
    "The term `bit` stands for `binary digit`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When `data` is stored in a `byte`, the `computer` sets the eight `bits` to an `on/off pattern`\n",
    "that represents the `data`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on whether the `bit` is turned on or off, it can represent one or two different values.\n",
    "In `computer systems`, a `bit` that is turned off represents the number `0`, and a `bit` that is turned on represents the number `1`.\n",
    "This corresponds to the `binary numbering system`.\n",
    "In b`inary numbering system` all numeric values are written as sequences of `0s and 1s`.\n",
    "`Example:`\n",
    "10011101 = 157\n",
    "\n",
    "The position of each `digit` in a `binary number` has a value assigned to it.\n",
    "Starting with the right most `digit` and moving left, the position values `2**0, 2**1, 2**2, 2**3,` and so forth, as shown.\n",
    "To determine the `values` of a `binary number` you simply add up the position values of all the `1s`, the sum is the `value`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Storing Characters\n",
    "Any piece of `data` that is in a `computer's memory` must be stored as a `binary number`.\n",
    "When a character is stored it is first converted into `numeric code`, and is then stored as `memory`.\n",
    "over the year different `coding schemes` have been developed to represent `characters` in `computer memory`. The most important of these `coding schemes` is `ASCII`. `ASCII` is a set of `128 numeric codes` that represent the `English letters`, `various punctuation marks`, and `other characters`."
