    "# Introduction to Computers and programming\n",
    "### Introduction 1.1\n",
    "`Computers` perform such a wide variety of tasks because they can be `programmed` to.\\\n",
    "This means that`computers` are not designed to do just one job, but to do any job that their `program` tells them to do.\\\n",
    "\n",
    "A `program` is a set of instructions that a computer follows to perform task `Microsoft Word` and `PowerPoint` are `2` commonly used `programs`.\\\n",
    "`programs` are commonly referred to as `software`. All the `software` that we use to make our `computers` useful\\\n",
    "are created by individuals working as`programmers` or `software developers`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A `programmer` or `software developer`, is a person with the training and skills necessary to design, create, and test computer programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hardware and Software 1.2\n",
    "The `physical devices` of which a `computer` is made are referred to as the `computers' hardware`. The programs that run on the `computer` are\\\n",
    "referred to as `software`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The term `hardware` refers to all the `physical devices`, or  `components`, of which a `computer` is made. A `computer` is not a `single device` but a `system of devices` that all work together.\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical `computer system` consists of the following major `components`:\n",
    "- A central processing unit(CPU)\n",
    "- Main memory\n",
    "- secondary storage devices\n",
    "- output devices\n",
    "- input devices\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### The CPU\n",
    "When a `computer` is performing the tasks that a `program` tells it to do,\\\n",
    "we say that the `computer` is running or executing the `program`.\\\n",
    "The `central processing unit`, or `CPU`, is the part of the `computer` that actually runs the `programs`.\\\n",
    "The `CPU` is the most `important component` in a `computer`  because without it the `computer` would not run `software`.\\\n",
    "`CPUs` are all small chips known as `microprocessors`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main memory\n",
    "You can think of `main memory` as the `computers' work area`.\\\n",
    "This is where the `computer` stores a `program` while the `program` is `running`,\\\n",
    "as well as the `data` the `program` is working with.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Secondary Storage device \n",
    "`Secondary Storage` is a type of memory that can hold `data` for long periods of time,\\\n",
    "even when there is no power to the `computer`. `Programs` are normally stored in `secondary`\\\n",
    "`memory` and loaded into `main memory` as needed. Important `data`, such as w`ord processing documents`,\\\n",
    "`payroll data`, and `inventory records`, is saved in `secondary storage` as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most common type of `secondary storage device` is the `disk drive`.\\\n",
    "A `traditional disk drive` stores `data` by magnetically encoding it onto a spinning circular disk.\n",
    " \n",
    "`External storage devices`, which connect to one of the `computers' communication ports`,\\\n",
    "are also available. `External storage devices` can be used to create backup copies of important\n",
    "data or to move data to another computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "`For example:`\n",
    "`USB drives` are small devices tha plug into the `computers' USB port` and appear to the system as a `disk drive`.\\\n",
    "These `drives` do not actually contain a `disk` , however, the store data in a special type of memory known as `flash memory`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input devices\n",
    "`Input` is any `data` the `computer` collects from people and from other `devices`.\\\n",
    "The `component` that collects `data` and sends it to the `computer` is called an `input device`.\\\n",
    "Common input devices are `keyboard`, `mouse`, `touchscreen`, `scanner`, `microphone`, and `digital cam`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output devices\n",
    "`Output` is any data the `computer` produces for people or for other `devices`.\\\n",
    "It might be a `sales report`, `a list of names`, or a `graphic image`.\\\n",
    "The `data` is sent to an `output device`, which `formats` and `presents` it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Software\n",
    "Everything a computer does from the time you turn the power switch on until you shut the `system` down,\\\n",
    "is under the control of `software`\n",
    "\n",
    "### System software\n",
    "The `programs` that control and manage the basic operations of a `computer` are referred to as `system software`.\\\n",
    "`system software` typically includes the following types of `programs`:\n",
    "\n",
    "`Operating Systems:`\n",
    "An `Operating System` is the most `fundamental` set of `programs` on a `computer`.\\\n",
    "The `operating system` controls the `internal operations` of the `computers hardware`,\\\n",
    "manages all the `devices` connected to the `computer`, allows `data` to be `saved` to and `retrieved`\\\n",
    "from `storage devices` and allows other `programs` to run on the `computer`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Utility Programs:`\n",
    "A `Utility Program` performs a specialized task that `enhances` the `computers' operation` or `safeguards data`.\\\n",
    "For example: `virus scanners`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Software Development Tools:`\n",
    "`Software Development Tools` are the `programs` that `programmers` use to `create`, `modify`, and `test` `software`.\\\n",
    "`Assemblers`, `Compilers`, and `interpreters` are good examples of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How computers store data 1.3\n",
    "A `computers memory` is divided into tiny storage locations known as `bytes`.\\\n",
    "One `byte` is enough memory to store a letter of the alphabet or a small number.\\\n",
    "In order to do anything meaningful, a `computer` has to have lots of `bytes`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each `byte` is divided into eight smaller `storage` known as `bits`.\\\n",
    "The term `bit` stands for `binary digit`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When `data` is stored in a `byte`, the `computer` sets the eight `bits` to an `on/off pattern`\\\n",
    "that represents the `data`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on whether the `bit` is turned on or off, it can represent one or two different values.\\\n",
    "In `computer systems`, a `bit` that is turned off represents the number `0`, and a `bit` that is turned on represents the number `1`.\\\n",
    "This corresponds to the `binary numbering system`.\\\n",
    "In b`inary numbering system` all numeric values are written as sequences of `0s and 1s`.\\\n",
    "`Example:`\n",
    "10011101 = 157\n",
    "\n",
    "The position of each `digit` in a `binary number` has a value assigned to it.\\\n",
    "Starting with the right most `digit` and moving left, the position values `2**0, 2**1, 2**2, 2**3,` and so forth, as shown.\\\n",
    "To determine the `values` of a `binary number` you simply add up the position values of all the `1s`, the sum is the `value`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Storing Characters\n",
    "Any piece of `data` that is in a `computer's memory` must be stored as a `binary number`.\\\n",
    "When a character is stored it is first converted into `numeric code`, and is then stored as `memory`.\\\n",
    "over the year different `coding schemes` have been developed to represent `characters` in `computer memory`.\\\n",
    "The most important of these `coding schemes` is `ASCII`. `ASCII` is a set of `128 numeric codes` that represent\\\n",
    "the `English letters`, `various punctuation marks`, and `other characters`. `ASCII` is limited, however because\\\n",
    "it defines codes for only `128` characters. To remedy this, the `unicode` character set was developed in the early 1990s.\\\n",
    "`Unicode` is an extensive `encoding scheme` that is compatible with `ASCII` but can also represent characters for\\\n",
    "many of the languages in the world. Today, `Unicode` is quickly becoming the standard character set used in the computers' industry.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advanced Number Storage\n",
    "`Negative numbers` and `real numbers` cannot be represented using the `simple binary numbering technique` we discussed.\\\n",
    "`Computers` are able to store `negative numbers` and `real numbers` in memory, but to do so they use `encoding schemes`\\\n",
    "along with the `binary numbering system`. `Negative numbers` are encoded using a technique known as `two's complement`, and\\\n",
    "`real numbers` are encoded in `floating point notation`.(You don't need to know how these encoding systems work)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Other types of data\n",
    "`Computers` are often referred to as `digital devices`. The term `digital` can be used to describe anything that\\\n",
    "uses `binary numbers`. `Digital data` is `data` that is stored in `binary format`, and a `digital device` is any\\\n",
    "device that works with `binary data`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How a Program Works\n",
    "A computer's `CPU` can only understand instructions that are written in `machine language`. Because people find it very\\\n",
    "difficult to write entire`programs` in `machine language`, other `programming languages` have been invented.\\\n",
    "Earlier we stated the `CPU` is the most `important component` in a`computer`because it is the part of the `computer`\\\n",
    "that runs `programs`. Somtimes the `CPU` is called the `computers' brain` and is described as\\\n",
    "being `smart.` A `CPU` is an `electronic device` that is designed to do specific things.\\\n",
    "In particular the `CPU` is designed to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Reading a piece of data from the main memory\n",
    "- Adding two numbers\n",
    "- Subtracting one number from another number\n",
    "- Multiplying two numbers\n",
    "- Dividing one number by another number\n",
    "- Moving a piece of data from one memory location to another\n",
    "- Determine whether one value is equal to another value\n",
    "\n",
    "The `CPU` performs simple `operations`  on pieces of `data`. The `CPU` does nothing on its own, however.\\\n",
    "It has to be told what to do, and that's the purpose of a `program`. A `program` is nothing more than\\\n",
    "a list of `instructions` that cause the `CPU` to perform `operations`.\\\n",
    "Here is an example of said `instructions`:\n",
    "`10110000`\n",
    "When a `CPU` executes the `instructions` in a `program`, it is engaged in a process that is known as the `fetch-decode-execute cycle`.\\\n",
    "This cycle which consist of three steps, is repeated for each instruction in the program.\\\n",
    "The steps are:\n",
    "- **`Fetch`**. A program is a long sequence of instructions. The first step of the cycle is to fetch,\n",
    "- or read, the next instruction from memory into the CPU.\n",
    "- **`Decode`**. A machine language instruction is a binary number represents a command that tells the CPU to perform an operation.\n",
    "- In this step, the CPU decodes the instruction that was just fetched from memory, to determine it should perform.\n",
    "- **`Execute`**. The last in the cycle is to execute, or perform, the operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### From Machine Language to Assembly Language\n",
    "`Computers` can only execute `programs` that are written in `machine language`. As previously mentioned a `program` can have thousands or even millions\\\n",
    "of binary instructions, and writing such a `program` would be very tedious and time-consuming. `Programming` in `machine language` would also\\\n",
    "be very difficult, because putting  a 0 or a 1 in the wrong place will cause an error. Although a `computers`' `CPU`\\\n",
    "only understands `machine language`, it is impractical for people to write `programs` in `machine language`.\\\n",
    "For this reason, `assembly language` was created in the early days of computing as an alternative to `machine language`.\\\n",
    "Instead of using `binary numbers` for instructions, `assembly languages` uses short words that are known `mnemonics`.\\\n",
    "For example, in `assembly language`,  the `mnemonics` **`add`** typically adds numbers, **`mul`** typically multiplies numbers,\\\n",
    "and **`mov`** typically means to move a value to a location in `memory`.\\\n",
    "The `CPU` only understands `machine language`, so a special program known as `assembler` is used to translate an `assembly language`\\\n",
    "program to a `machine language program`. \n",
    "\n",
    "### High-Level Languages\n",
    "Although `assembly language` makes it unnecessary to write `binary machine language` instructions, it is not without difficulties.\\\n",
    "`Assembly language` is primarily a direct substitute for `machine language`, and like `machine language`,\\\n",
    "it requires that you know alot about the `CPU`. `Assembly language` also requires that write a large number of `instructions`\\\n",
    "for even the simplests `programs`. Because `assembly language` is so close in nature to `machine language` it is referred to as\\\n",
    "`low-level languages`. In the `1950s`, a new generation of `programming languages` known as `high-level languages` began to appear.\\\n",
    "A `high-level language` allows you to create powerful and complex `programs` without knowing the `CPU` works and without writing\\\n",
    "large numbers of `low-level instructions`. In addition, most `high-level languages` use words that easy to understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Python` is a modern, `high-level programming language` that we will use. In `Python`, you would display the message `Hello World`\\\n",
    "with the following on the computer screen:\n",
    "```\n",
    "print(\"Hello World\")\n",
    "```\n",
